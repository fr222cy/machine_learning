'Google develops invisible web security Captcha form Website security checks that challenge people to prove they are human are likely to \"disappear\" in favour of a new system developed by Google. Captcha checks typically ask people to complete a puzzle that a computer would struggle to complete correctly. They are designed to stop automated bots accessing and using websites. Google\'s new system tracks how a person interacts with a website to prove they are real, so the puzzles are no longer necessary for most people. Captcha checks are often deployed by concert ticket websites to stop people setting up automated bots to buy all the best tickets. They also appear when somebody is trying to log in to a website with the wrong password, to spot automated attempts. The puzzles present challenges that people find simple but computers can find more difficult, such as: identifying photographs of dogs in a gallery of animal pictures typing numbers from a photograph of a road sign into a box listening to somebody reading out numbers over music and typing the numbers into a box The puzzles also benefit companies such as Google by helping train artificial intelligence algorithms. For example, if Google\'s AI can not recognise a house number in a photograph taken by a Streetview car, it may add the photo to its Captcha system to get human input. However, genuine users can find the interruption by puzzles a nuisance. Google\'s reCaptcha system has already simplified the process by asking users to tick a check box on the website they are using. The box monitors how each person has interacted with it, to separate natural human clicks from bots. For example, an automated script might take just a second to fill in a form on a website, and may not move the mouse at all during the process. Google\'s latest development removes the check box as well, and instead analyses how people have interacted with other elements on a website such as the \"submit form\" button. However, in some cases \"suspicious\" activity will still trigger a puzzle.',tech
'Commonwealth Games: A joint bid for 2022 would be considered A bid from UK cities to jointly host the 2022 Commonwealth Games would be considered by Games chiefs. Birmingham, Liverpool, London and Manchester have expressed interest in staging the Games in place of Durban. Durban was due to be the first African city to host the games but Commonwealth Games Federation chief David Grevemberg said officials were looking to make a decision quickly and would consider a joint bid.\"We are interested in looking at different delivery models and part of our strategic plan is to look at more affordable and appealing structures for hosting major events,\" said Grevemberg.\"There is a possibility in the future that we could look at combined events but at this point in time we are trying to ensure we deliver the best possible Games in the best possible city.\"Right now we are not speculating on any specific candidates over another.\"We really need to look over the context, time available, infrastructure, what is the resourcing base and ensure that we are able to have a good fit and a good partner.\"',sport
'The wine boss who was glad to be sacked Rowan Gormley says he had no idea that he was about to be sacked. Back in June 2008, as the founder and boss of Virgin Wines, he was trying to lead a management buyout from its then-parent group Direct Wines.\"I got called into a meeting, I thought it was to discuss the purchase price,\" says Mr Gormley, now 54. \"Instead, a letter was pushed across the table to me, which said I was being dismissed.\"I immediately walked out of the room and tried to use my [company] mobile phone, but it had been barred while I had been in the meeting.\"Mr Gormley says he immediately decided that as buying back Virgin Wines was now impossible, he would instead set up a rival business. But he faced a race against time to get key staff to leave with him. \"I went across the road to a shop and bought another telephone as quickly as I could,\" he says. \"I phoned the office, and the guy I spoke to said, \'oh my God, there is an army of people here trying to get us to sign bits of paper saying we are not going to talk to you, and all sorts of things.\'\"So I gave him a list of 17 people and said, \'tell these 17 not to sign anything.\'\" Thankfully for Mr Gormley, the staff that he most wanted to keep decided to follow him out the door, and six months later he launched his new venture - Naked Wines. Today he is the boss of both Naked Wines and fellow UK wine retailer Majestic Wine, which have combined annual sales of more than £300m.\"I think I was sacked because of a clash of personalities, or perhaps egos, but it was honestly the best thing that ever happened to me,\" says Mr Gormley. \"Otherwise Naked would never have happened, nor would I have gone on to also lead Majestic.\"\'Dotcom mistakes\' Born and bred in South Africa, Mr Gormley says he first became interested in wine as a teenager. But before he started selling it in his late 30s, he spent almost two decades working in finance. After going to university in Cape Town, he trained as an accountant, and moved to the UK in his mid-20s. Mr Gormley then worked in private equity for seven years before joining Sir Richard Branson\'s Virgin Group. It was Mr Gormley\'s idea for Sir Richard to move into offering financial services, and Virgin Money was born in 1995. Five years later Mr Gormley said he came up with the idea for Virgin Wines, saying he recognised the opportunity of selling wine via the then-still nascent internet.\"I pitched the idea to the Virgin guys but they weren\'t very excited about it. So I started just selling wine at nights and weekends with my brother and friend to prove that it worked,\" he says, \"and six months later Virgin Wines was born.\"But he says he and Virgin Wines immediately \"made all the classic dotcom mistakes\".\"We did everything wrong - we had a flash London headquarters, a huge IT office, a big advertising campaign, and absolutely nothing worked.\" Ultimately, Mr Gormley says that for Virgin Wines to survive it had to cut its workforce by 90\%, \"retreat to Norwich with our tails between our legs\", and start again from the very bottom. In addition to cutting costs, Mr Gormley says he turned around the company by focusing on selling interesting wines from small producers instead of selling the same big brands that people could buy from the supermarkets. By the time he and his team had managed to make Virgin Wines profitable, it was sold to larger UK firm Direct Wines in 2005, only for Mr Gormley to be sacked three years later. Discount vouchers At Naked, Mr Gormley\'s big idea was to encourage customers to become \"angels\", who pay a direct debit of £20 a month, in exchange for getting wine at reduced prices. Naked then uses this money to pay independent wine producers in advance, so that they can focus all their energies on making the wine instead of worrying about being able to sell it. Winemakers are also profiled extensively on Naked\'s website (it is an online only operation), and customers are encouraged to review each wine, including saying whether they would buy it again. To drive sales the company gave away free samples, and today it has more than 320, 000 angels. Such has been the growth of the business since it was founded in 2008 that it was . The deal made Mr Gormley many millions, but instead of retiring to count his cash, he was given the top job at Majestic, and tasked with turning around its fortunes after three years of poor sales and weak profits at its UK stores and website. Mr Gormley\'s action plan has seen him focus on raising staffing levels at Majestic\'s 211 UK shops to try to boost both customer service and staff morale, and allowing customers to buy just one bottle of wine rather than the previous minimum order of six. \"Majestic has to offer better service, and give people the type of help and advice that they don\'t get in a supermarket,\" he says. While the company is still struggling to make a profit, and an expansion into the US has not been successful, group sales are now rising strongly again. Retail analyst Jonathan Pritchard of stockbrokerage Peel Hunt says he would score Mr Gormley\'s first two years leading Majestic as \"eight out of 10\". He adds: \"He is a fabulous entrepreneur, and a very good presenter - he is excellent at getting his message across - but there have been a few bumps in the road since he took over.\"UK wine journalists have mixed opinions. The Daily Mail\'s Olly Smith says Mr Gormley is \"something of a visionary and powerhouse in connecting wine directly with consumers\", but Jamie Goode from the Wine Anorak blog complains that the pre-discount prices at Naked are too high. Mr Gormley says his focus is always on selling enjoyable wines.\"I don\'t regard myself as having a great palate, but I consider that to be an advantage,\" he says. \"Too many people who are really into wine see their tastes become so esoteric and refined that normal people don\'t like what they drink. I\'m not like that at all.\"Follow The Boss series editor Will Smale on Twitter ',business
'Trump and the media - Is it war or love? For the past week I have been in New York and Washington, talking to key players in the media here. By that, I don\'t just mean the hated mainstream media, whatever that phrase means. I\'ve also spoken to conservative talk radio hosts who think of Donald Trump as an emissary from the promised land. And I\'ve come closer to understanding Trump\'s highly coherent media strategy. In short, his \"war with\" the media ought to be updated to \"marriage to\" - or \"affair with\". It turns out, some weeks back, that the man alleged to be at war with the media is threatening to create a golden age for it. Whether liberal, conservative or neither; print, television, radio or web, this former reality TV star is boosting subscribers, traffic, ratings and revenues all over the shop. Some people think Trump\'s pronouncements are not so much a media strategy as pure madness. Perhaps so. Yet - like Polonius - I detect method in it. Three principles, simple and wholly unoriginal each, have coagulated to create it. In their variety and efficacy, they contain lessons not just on the psychology of this remarkable leader, but also the nature of modern media. A dead cat on a table First, Trump evinces a disarming fondness for dead cats. Not literally, you understand. I mean the dead cats that Lynton Crosby specialised in. You may recall that the Australian strategist, one of the most effective campaign managers and manipulators of media in modern history, had a habit of throwing \'dead cats\' into the national conversation. The technique is simple. If you and I were having a conversation, and then suddenly someone threw a dead cat onto a table, we\'d stop talking about whatever riveting subject had heretofore detained us, and talk about the dead cat instead. Dead cats appearing out of nowhere are more interesting than most subjects of daily conversation. Trump\'s about his predecessor wire-tapping his phones is probably the most lively dead cat in our time. One simple claim - for which many US media say he lacks robust evidence, and that could not be substantiated by spokesman Sean Spicer - has dominated the news agenda for a week, and taken the sting out of stories about Trump\'s relationship with Russia. Second, use digital media to speak directly to the base, without the filter of journalistic judgement and interpretation. Trump notoriously uses social media to cut journalists out of the picture. Why bother being interviewed by a pesky hack, when you have s on Twitter? But because journalists are so fond of Twitter - it\'s a personalised news feed, after all - there can be a tendency to ignore Facebook, where Trump also has more than , who between them have social networks with hundreds of millions of people. And so too talk radio, which is a bigger phenomenon in the US than Britain. Trump often speaks to the likes of Rush Limbaugh. Andrew Wilkow presents on Sirius XM\'s The Patriot Channel, which boasts 31. 3 million subscribers (\"We\'re Right. They\'re Wrong\"). He told me that conservative talk radio hosts have been uniquely effective in exploiting the opportunities of digital media. He said American journalism had for years been a \"closed guild\", but that had now been smashed open. Third, favour conservative and even conspiratorial media outlets in press briefings. We know that Spicer, whose asserts that it is the role of government to hold the media to account, has sometimes cut traditional media out of briefings. A marriage of convenience? We know that the most powerful voice in Trump\'s ear is that of Stephen Bannon, the anti-globalist who used to run Breitbart News. And we know from his courting of Fox News that Trump will unashamedly focus his limited time for interviews on sympathetic outlets. He has also given plenty of time, for instance, to Alex Jones of Infowars. I interviewed Mark Thompson, the former Director-General of the BBC who is now President and CEO of the New York Times. They have seen subscriber numbers soar. When I asked if Trump\'s war with media was a marriage of convenience, Thompson told me that he certainly didn\'t think of his company as being in partnership with Trump - but there have been very sharp increases in willingness to pay for news. The year-on-year increase in Times subscribers has added several million dollars in net revenue. They might have grown had Trump never run for office. But this much? No way. It is, then, an abiding irony of our age that the sustenance of decent and often liberal journalism owes so much to a man who is instinctively suspicious of reporters and popularised the term \"fake news\". Dean Baquet, the Executive Editor of the New York Times, said Trump had helped his team to \"clarify their mission\". After a decade of soul-searching, he added, the news industry has found that its new mission turns out to be similar to the old one: dig deep, find stuff out, and report it fairly. When, a few weeks ago, this blog pointed out that far from being an enemy of the press, Trump is in fact its saviour, I wondered if comrades in the trade would be offended at the suggestion. To my surprise, many were sympathetic. Trump is a journalistic challenge in so many ways. How do you reconcile presidential falsehoods with the duty of impartiality? Should you really hang on his every tweet? What does political journalism look like when you get no access to the top? Aside from all that, however, is another quandary. They might find him unappealing. He might seem hostile to all their most sacred principles. But Trump has put journalists - and journalism - in a debt to him that will never be fully serviced.',entertainment
'Theresa May signs £1. 3bn Swansea Bay City deal Prime Minister Theresa May has signed off the Swansea Bay City Region deal, insisting she wants Wales \"at the forefront of science and innovation\". The plan is expected to create more than 9, 000 jobs and trigger almost £1. 3bn of investment in south west Wales. Mrs May said the deal would help show a country which \"works for everyone\". It comes as First Minister Carwyn Jones told the Guardian Mrs May had a on issues of devolution. Downing Street said Mrs May\'s visits to the four UK nations, which began in Wales, would ensure the government was \"engaging and listening to people from right across the nation\" as it prepared to leave the European Union. Mrs May and Mr Jones joined the leaders of four councils - Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire and Swansea - to sign the deal at Swansea\'s Liberty Stadium on Monday. Speaking at the ceremony, the prime minister said last June\'s Brexit referendum vote was not just about leaving the EU, but about voters wanting \"a change in the way the country works\".\"It is part of our plan for Britain,\" she said. \"It\'s important for this part of Wales. It will be about ensuring that prosperity, growth, that opportunity is available to everyone.\" Mr Jones added: \"I\'m a strong believer that we are at our best when governments co-operate. Today is a good example of that.\"As well as meeting the first minister, Mrs May met representatives from a range of sectors and businesses during the visit. What is the Swansea Bay City Region Deal? £1. 3bn of private and public money to be spent over 15 years £241m from UK and Welsh governments, £360m from the public sector and universities, and another £673m in private investment Four councils - Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire and Swansea - taking part Eleven projects including: a \"cloud\" enterprise zone to attract data companies; using the internet to improve health diagnostics; a steel science centre Speaking ahead of the signing, Mr Jones said it was a \"transformative deal that will drive the regional economy in a new direction, supported by high-quality jobs and a digital infrastructure\". Rob Stewart, leader of Swansea council and the city region, said: \"This is among the biggest investments Wales has ever seen, so it\'s a historic day for the Swansea Bay City Region.\"There was criticism of the deal, however. Prof Dylan Jones-Evans from Bristol Business School said that while the deal was \"vitally important\", the deal\'s strategy was \"very different\" to that originally proposed by tycoon Sir Terry Matthews. Mr Jones-Evans said the deal had gone away from \"investing in infrastructure and people\" towards \"building more buildings\".\"It is a strategy that has been discredited by economic development organisations around the world,\" he said.\"The question is why they are doing it here in Swansea Bay.\" \"The internet coast\" may sound like a slightly over-ambitious title for the change it is hoped the Swansea Bay City Deal could bring, when in some parts of the region people struggle with a weak mobile signal. But if the ambition for the bay area to be a test-bed for 5G technology is realised, then we can imagine a whole raft of other industries developing. 5G would work through Wi-Fi routers not masts, which is the case with 3G technology. This would make coverage much more robust. The massively increased speed of 5G would also make virtual reality more accessible and pave the way for the software for driverless cars to operate. For Wales, that could significantly help existing industries such as life sciences and the automotive sector. As the car industry invests in driverless cars, the existence of 5G would make south west Wales a more attractive place for businesses in that sector to develop. Similarly, 5G could enable high definition video which would enable more detailed health care monitoring.',politics
'MWC 2017: Huawei P10 has smarter selfie and rear cameras Huawei\'s latest high-end smartphone features a camera on its front that counts how many people are in shot. If the P10 detects there is more than one person being photographed in a \"selfie\", it automatically switches from standard to wide-angle mode. The phone\'s rear cameras also use use 3D depth-sensing technology to help enhance portraits. Analysts said the device only marks a relatively minor improvement on last year\'s well-received model. It was unveiled on the eve of Mobile World Congress, a tech trade show in Barcelona. \"I think it\'s deliberately incremental, but I don\'t think that\'s a problem,\" commented Ben Wood from CCS Insight.\"It makes it an even more refined version of the P9, which was a milestone device for Huawei as it took them from being a relative unknown to a player with a credible top-end smartphone.\" The Chinese firm is currently the world\'s third bestselling smartphone-maker. It has said it intends to be one of the top two by the end of 2018. The company shipped more than 139 million handsets last year - according to market analysis by IDC - which represented a 30\% gain on 2015. That put Huawei\'s share of 2016\'s smartphone market at 9\%, behind Apple with 15\% and Samsung with 21\%. Auto-enhanced images The P10 continues Huawei\'s alliance with Leica, the German camera-maker whose brand is stamped on the phone\'s photo sensor components. As before, there are two of these cameras on the rear of the device, one capturing colour, the other black-and-white data - the information is combined to create a single 12 megapixel colour image or used to deliver a 20 megapixel monochrome one. What is new, is that software now analyses the difference between the two images to work out the position and size of the subject\'s various facial features - such as how big a nose they have. This is then used to adjust the lighting, shadows and skin colours to try and produce more flattering portraits. In addition, Huawei has built in software co-developed by the action camera-maker GoPro to automatically create photo books and videos. The firm has also moved the fingerprint sensor from the rear of the device to the front. The standard P10 has a 5. 1in 1080p high definition display, while the P10 Plus has a 5. 5in higher resolution component. The Plus will cost €699 (£590) and up while the standard P10 will sell for €649. Much of the firm\'s press conference was dedicated to the fact they now come in blue and green bodies among other options.\"If you saw it against the P9 you might think: what\'s the difference?\" commented David McQueen from ABI Research.\"What Huawei has done is really push the camera features and functionality. \"That will appeal to keen photographers, but others won\'t notice much improvement.\"Analysis: Chris Foxx, Technology reporter Phone-makers usually take to the stage at Mobile World Congress to explain the new features of their latest handset in a glitzy no-expense-spared presentation. Huawei certainly didn\'t scrimp on the venue or staging. Strange, then, that it spent the first 25 minutes talking about colours. In unparalleled detail. Did you know for example that the colour blue symbolises \"constancy\", because the sky has not fallen and it is blue. Except of course when it is orange, or red. Or black. The in-depth colour briefing was more suited to a private internal design meeting at Huawei, rather than being broadcast to the world\'s press. As the speaker announced the conclusion of her speech about the colour blue, a few savage cheers rang out in the auditorium. But at least it got the message across. The phone is now a bit better than last year, and comes in blue. ',tech
'Sergio Aguero: Striker says Manchester City have not spoken to him about his future Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero says the club are yet to speak to him about where his future lies. Speculation about Aguero\'s future intensified after he lost his place to 19-year-old Gabriel Jesus last month. Manager Pep Guardiola says but Aguero, who is contracted to the club until 2020, says he has not had any discussions about staying with City. \"It is one thing for the club to say it and another to tell me,\" he said. Aguero has scored four goals in two games after reclaiming his place when Jesus suffered a broken foot that could rule him out for the season. He scored twice in the on Wednesday to take his tally for the season to 22. Guardiola described it as Aguero\'s \"best performance of the season\". Aguero is third on City\'s all-time scoring records with 158, 20 behind Eric Brook, who is first, and eight adrift of second-placed Tommy Johnson.

'Sainsbury\'s sales fall but Argos growth strengthens Sales have fallen at Sainsbury\'s in the first nine weeks of the year, but the newly-acquired Argos reported strong growth. The supermarket\'s like-for-like sales, which strip out new stores, fell by 0. 5\% in the period to 11 March. However, Argos sales rose 4. 3\%, resulting in a 0. 3\% increase excluding fuel across the Sainsbury\'s group. Sainsbury\'s said the market remained \"very competitive\" and the impact of cost pressures \"remains uncertain\". The supermarket\'s performance was worse than the 0. 1\% rise in like-for-like sales seen in the 15 weeks to 7 January. Sainsbury\'s convenience stores saw total sales growth of almost 7\%, with 10 new outlets opening in the quarter. Chief executive Mike Coupe said customers had welcomed Sainsbury\'s \"differentiated food offer\", with new products including butternut squash waffles and sweet potato tagliatelle. General merchandise sales were down 4\%, which Sainsbury\'s said was due to Easter and Mother\'s Day falling later this year. Sainsbury\'s bought catalogue retailer Argos last year as part of its £1. 4bn takeover of Home Retail Group.

Jan : \"Cannot believe that Loose Women is not on TV on International Women\'s Day,\" while Mark Williams the decision was a \"bit weird\". \'Not an outrage\' It\'s fair to say dropping a show fronted by four women in favour of a middle-aged white man in a suit reading out numbers probably isn\'t what our ancestors had in mind when the first Women\'s Day was held in 1909. But Ruth Langsford had already told viewers that the show would only be absent for one day and the team would return on Thursday. \"Just to remind you we\'re not here tomorrow because of an ITV News Budget special,\" she said at the end of Tuesday\'s programme.\"I\'m sorry, but the good news is we are back on Thursday and Gok Wan will be here.\"Good news indeed.

'Warning of inner-UK \'trade war\' post-Brexit The first minister has warned of a \"trade war\" between the nations of the United Kingdom unless new rules are established post-Brexit. Carwyn Jones made the claim as he announced Labour will undertake a constitutional convention to discuss the future make-up of the UK. He warned an inability to set UK-wide trade rules \"could cost jobs\". Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said he was baffled by Mr Jones\' comments. Speaking to BBC Wales\' programme, Mr Jones said: \"At the moment there are rules. There are EU state aid rules that govern what we can and can\'t do. \"If there are no rules, it becomes a free-for-all. That\'s a bad thing for any single market.\"EU state aid rules regulate how much help governments can give to local industries. Mr Jones said an inability to set UK-wide trade rules after Brexit \"could cost jobs, it could cost a lot of money - that affects ordinary people, and that needs to be resolved as soon as possible.\" Welsh Conservative Leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"I\'m baffled by his pronunciation of a trade war. \"As I last looked at the constitutional settlement, trade and industry certainly wasn\'t devolved and international negotiation was not devolved.\"Mr Jones also told the programme that the battle to keep the United Kingdom together \"will be lost\" unless the UK government starts listening to the devolved nations.\"We can share power in the UK, we can still be stable, we can still have the union, but the UK government needs to realise this now otherwise the battle will be lost,\" he said.\"They need to wake up and smell the coffee.\"\'More powers\' Senior party figures from across Britain, including former prime minister Gordon Brown, will attend the launch of the constitutional convention in Cardiff at the end of March.

Adam Price, the party\'s economy spokesman, said: \"Rather than the Labour party talking to itself, why doesn\'t it talk to the rest of us?\"UKIP assembly group leader Neil Hamilton said he thought Brexit would lead to \"more powers\" to the devolved institutions.

'Tech 2016: BBC News Online\'s biggest technology stories Another year of tech news is nearly over. It has been an eventful 12 months. Samsung smartphones exploded, GoPro drones dropped out of the air and Pebble smartwatches met an untimely end. Facebook became embroiled in a fake news controversy, Yahoo revealed several mega-breaches, we identified the supposed creator of Bitcoin - who then went AWOL - and millions indulged in a game of Pokemon Go. Yet none of those stories made our most-read-of-the-month list - based on the number of times an article was clicked - as you can see below. There is a good rule of thumb: if you do not want your employer to know what you are up to online, wait until you are not on the job. And at the start of 2016, a Romanian company successfully argued it was within its rights to read Yahoo Messenger chats sent by one of its staff. The sales engineer had claimed his privacy had been invaded as he had posted details about his health and sex life, but the European Court of Human Rights noted he had previously been warned not to send personal messages within working hours. However, later in the year, the man appealed and the case was reconsidered. The ECHR will now issue a fresh ruling in early 2017. Apple clashed with the FBI when it refused to unlock an iPhone used by a murderer. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik had killed 14 people in a shooting spree in California before being shot dead themselves. Farook\'s iPhone 5C was password-protected and the FBI feared that if it tried and failed to guess the combination, the device would auto-delete. The agency demanded a bypass, but Apple refused to help saying it would set a dangerous precedent. A legal battle ensued, but then suddenly ended when the FBI declared an unnamed third party had found its own way to access the data. For now, the matter rests. But at the height of the stand-off, Donald Trump called on consumers to boycott Apple. That is likely to serve as a warning to any tech firm tempted to take a similar stance in a future dispute. Amazon\'s bosses sounded somewhat distrustful when it was reported that they had started screening videos of staff caught stealing on the job via big TVs in their US warehouses. The alleged offenders were said to have been silhouetted with the words \"arrested\" and \"terminated\" superimposed over them. It was not the only time working conditions at the company made headlines. Earlier this month, Amazon was also accused of if they took four days off for sickness even if they had a doctor\'s note. It must have seemed like a hilarious idea. To celebrate April Fool\'s Day, Google added a button to its Gmail app to let users send a gif of a Minion cartoon character dropping a microphone. symbolises a triumphant moment and had been popularised by rappers, actors and even a fast food chain. So what could go wrong? Well, because of a \"bug\" some users reported the gif had been added even if they clicked Gmail\'s normal \"send\" button. People complained of having the yellow henchman pop up in inappropriate messages. One man even claimed it had cost him his job. Despicable Google! As the shutters began to close on Microsoft\'s free Windows 10 offer, it faced a challenge. Many were ignoring its pop-up plea to upgrade and were opting instead to stick with earlier versions of the operating system. So, in an effort to spur them on, the firm embarked on a mischievous strategy: clicking on the cross in the pop-up\'s top right-hand corner no longer dismissed the Windows update but triggered it instead. The move was widely denounced and Microsoft soon added a further notification message providing users with another chance to opt out before the software was installed. The firm\'s the whole affair had been \"a lowlight\" for all involved. BBC Click\'s Dan Simmons was invited to visit the world\'s highest and longest glass-bottomed bridge ahead of its launch in China. He took a sledgehammer with him. You can view the results in the clip above. It\'s smashing! The bridge opened to the public in August, but was closed again a fortnight later for urgent maintenance work. We understand Dan was not to blame. While other car-makers talked up their self-driving vehicle plans, Tesla went ahead and deployed a restricted form of the tech. The firm described its Autopilot feature as being a \"beta\" test, but it faced criticism when a former Navy Seal died after his Model S car failed to recognise a tractor trailer and ploughed into it. Weeks later, another non-fatal crash involving Autopilot occurred in the US, and then unconfirmed reports emerged from China that another motorist had died in a motorway crash while using the feature. Tesla continues to roll out updates to Autopilot and its chief executive Elon Musk says the technology has the potential to save many lives. But critics - including the German and Dutch authorities - have urged Tesla to rebrand the system to discourage drivers from putting too much trust in it. Every summer, many of the world\'s top hackers, cybersecurity experts and government officials descend on Las Vegas for the Defcon and Black Hat conferences. To mark the events, a flurry of new cracks and bugs are revealed as researchers compete for recognition from their peers and the wider public. This year\'s break-out revelation was about flaws in software used on Android devices powered by Qualcomm chips, which could be exploited to reveal their users\' data. By the time the news was made public, Qualcomm had already developed a patch and Google fixed outstanding issues in an Android update released in September. Usually new hardware is all about what has been added. But the iPhone 7 made headlines because of Apple\'s decision to build it without a headphone jack - a decision that took \"courage\" apparently. To be fair, the move helped Apple make the handset more water-resistant, and others - including Samsung - are now rumoured to be considering similar moves. But the path to a wireless music-playing future was not totally smooth after Apple had problems getting its accompanying AirPod earphones to market after running into . The hiccup has now been addressed, but a backlog in orders means many users will not be able to pop the new tech into their ear canals until the new year. Daughters... it does not matter how powerful you are, they are still prone to gain the the upper hand. President Obama revealed on TV that his youngest child, Sasha, had recorded him \"lecturing\" his family on Snapchat and other social media. He said she then secretly posted her reaction - a look of boredom - to her friends via the app. The anecdote sparked a brief media frenzy as gossip writers and others sought to track down Sasha\'s Snapchat account, but to no avail. Apple clocked up its third \"win\" of the year after it offered a discount on connector adapters following criticism that its latest laptops lacked legacy ports. The firm has a habit of dropping support for historic hardware standards ahead of the competition and often before many of its consumers are ready. But this time even it acknowledged that it was surprised by the scale of the backlash it had provoked. Nostalgia had a certain role to play in our last popular story of the year, as Nokia revealed that handsets emblazoned with its brand are being promoted via its website once again. The Finnish firm is not actually making the mobiles this time round - a start-up called HMD Global is taking charge - but has lent its name for a fee. Nokia itself is more interested in virtual reality and smart health tech these days. But for many, its brand, ringtone and Snake game will be forever associated with the dawn of the mobile age. Whether or not many people will actually buy one of the existing featurephones or forthcoming Android smartphones is another matter. ',tech
'Gavin Henson joins Newport Gwent Dragons on two-year deal Wales\' double Grand Slam winner Gavin Henson is to join Newport Gwent Dragons from Bristol in the summer on a two-year contract. Henson, 35, won the last of his 33 Wales caps against England in 2011 and also played one Test for the British and Irish Lions in 2005.\"This is a hugely important signing and exactly what we need,\" said Dragons head coach, Kingsley Jones. Henson said: \"I still have loads to offer and I know what Kingsley wants.\"Henson joined Bristol in 2015 after spending time with London Welsh and Bath, and started his regional career in Wales with the Ospreys.

'The women still working into their 70s The proportion of women working into their 70s in the UK has doubled in the last four years and is starting to catch up with men. Analysis of official data reveals that 5. 6\% of women only stopped working after the age of 70 in 2012. This had risen to 11. 3\% in 2016. Worries over pension income and a motivation to stay active have pushed up working ages. An estimated 15. 5\% of men stopped work in their 70s in 2016. Changing laws and workplace regulations, such as the end to age discrimination and the right to request flexible hours, have also helped people to work for longer as longevity increases. An estimated 150, 000 women in the UK are working into their early 70s. Among them is Ann Green, who runs a fabric stall called Avon Textiles in Bristol\'s St Nicholas Market. She points to a lack of savings through pensions as the main reason for working on. \"We always invested our money into the business and into property to help us feel secure - so no other security at all,\" the 70-year-old said. \"It would certainly be a struggle, and life would have to change, if we stopped work.\"Women tend to have much smaller sums invested in private pensions, so have less to supplement their income in later life. Despite changes to the state pension for new retirees, many women have not qualified for the full payout owing to gaps in their national insurance contributions during career breaks to bring up children or other reasons. Elaine Weston, a 74-year-old former social worker, is one of those who does not receive the full state pension. Although her jewellery and furniture shop, Bliss, is a labour of love, she too says she needs the extra money. \"Women are getting younger! It is good to keep your brain and yourself active,\" she said.\"I just need a bit extra [money] to keep going. If I did not do this, I would just try to get a job. They talk about rich pensioners, but a lot of pensioners are not rich.\" She said that her house was her financial security, but she would have to sell up and move to a cheaper area if she stopped working. Nathan Long, senior pension analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown - the investment company that analysed the official figures - said: \"This jump in those leaving work over 70 may simply be through individual choice. Workers should be encouraged to work as late in life as they are able and feel is desirable.\"However it is also a reflection of the increasing strain on the pension system. The best days of well-funded early retirement are behind us. \"The risk to employers is of a workforce trapped in jobs they don\'t want to do, which will inevitably impact on productivity. The government has already set out their vision for fulfilling working lives, but its success requires employers to embrace flexible working, re-education of employees and the transfer of a lifetime of knowledge.\"Earlier in the year, the government launched a strategy aimed at encouraging the over-50s to consider a second career to extend their working lives.\"Staying in work for a few more years can make a significant difference, not only to someone\'s income but also their physical and mental health,\" said Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green.\"I urge all businesses to reassess the value of older workers. Nobody should write off hiring someone due to their age and it is unacceptable that some older people are overlooked for roles they would suit completely.\"',business
'Russia gives Beauty and the Beast a 16+ rating Russia\'s Culture Ministry is to allow the release of Disney\'s Beauty and the Beast - but children under the age of 16 will not be allowed to see it. The ministry has granted permission for the film - due out in Russia next week - to be screened with a 16+ age rating. The decision comes after a Russian MP petitioned Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky to ban it over the inclusion of a gay character. A Russian law prohibits the spreading of \"gay propaganda\" among minors. The 2013 legislation, which angered human rights activists and the international gay community, describes homosexuality as \"non-traditional sexual relations\".

It involves LeFou, played by US actor Josh Gad, who is a sidekick of the film\'s main antagonist Gaston. LeFou tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between lust and admiration, as a side-plot to the main story. Emma Watson plays Belle, the young girl who falls in love with a monstrous beast with a dark secret. Her suitors - the Beast and Gaston - are played by British stars Dan Stevens and Luke Evans.

'Corbyn tax return: Labour says media criticism \'entirely false\' Labour has hit out at \"entirely false\" claims over Jeremy Corbyn\'s tax return, saying he had made a \"complete and accurate\" declaration of his income., published on Sunday, appeared not to show the money he was entitled to as leader of the opposition. Labour said the £27, 192 sum was listed under pensions and benefits as Revenue &amp; Customs classified it that way. A spokesman suggested the proprietors of critical newspapers had \"questions to answer\" about their own tax affairs. Initially on Sunday, Labour said it welcomed media scrutiny of Mr Corbyn\'s financial affairs, but a spokesman for the leader now said it hoped that claims about the return made \"without verifying or confirming the facts\" would be corrected. The Labour leader published his 2015-16 tax return on his constituency website to demonstrate his commitment to \"openness and transparency\". The return appeared to show his salary as an MP, plus pension payments, but not the money he is entitled to as leader of the opposition. The return records Mr Corbyn\'s \"pay from all employments\" as £77, 019 - mostly from his MP\'s salary of £74, 000 - along with a pension and state benefits of £36, 045, £1, 200 from self-employment and £78 in interest. He paid income tax of £35, 298 for the year 2015-16, after becoming Labour leader in September 2015. A Labour source was initially unable to say why Mr Corbyn\'s leader\'s salary appeared to be missing from the return, which was prepared by accountants.\'Stand to lose\' But later a Labour spokesman said it was \"untrue\" the leadership payment had been omitted, saying it was included in the full return under the heading of \"public office\". The party later clarified the payment was included under the pension and benefits income because it was not counted as part of his salary. The apparent confusion was picked upon on by commentators, who said Labour had failed to answer simple questions about a form Mr Corbyn had chosen to publish himself and had not been required to do. In a further statement issued on Monday, Labour said Mr Corbyn had declared all his income and paid the \"appropriate amount\" of tax.\"The payment he received in 2015-16 as Leader of the Opposition appears on the return as a \'benefit\' rather than as pay because that is how it is categorised by Her Majesty\'s Revenue and Customs,\" it said\"This figure is calculated after deducting the waivers Jeremy has made of earlier increases to the benefit. These waivers were also made by his predecessor, Ed Miliband. A parliamentary pension contribution of £3, 395 was also deducted.\"\'Botched\' Labour said it was \"disappointed\" that the Cabinet Office had not clarified how the supplement was recorded for tax purposes when contacted by the media.\"It is also a matter of concern that some media organisations made entirely false claims... and we expect these now to be corrected,\" the statement added.\"The owners of the media companies that have attempted to cast doubt over Jeremy\'s transparent and accurate tax return are of course among those who could stand to lose from tax transparency and justice the British people demand.\"Jeremy believes firmly in transparency. These media barons have tax questions of their own to answer.\"But the statement prompted a backlash on social media, with suggesting Mr Corbyn\'s response to the \"botched\" form was to accuse the government and the media of a \"joint conspiracy\"said the whole episode had become a example of \"incompetence signalling\". And lawyer said the figures needed further explanation, since recording a salary supplement as a state benefit was \"not to stretch but to snap credibility\". The publication came after Chancellor Phillip Hammond declined a challenge to publish his own taxes, calling it \"demonstration politics\". Speaking to the BBC\'s , he said: \"I have no intention of doing so. Just for the record my tax affairs are all perfectly regular and up to date. But I think this demonstration politics isn\'t helping the atmosphere in British politics.\"',politics

'Football League Division Three: Armagh face Tipperary battle for promotion Armagh will battle with Tipperary for a Football League Division Three promotion spot next Sunday after the Premier County lost to Louth on Sunday. Louth beat last year\'s All-Ireland semi-finalists 0-16 to 0-12 in Thurles to go top on 10 points. Following their 1-12 to 0-13 win over Antrim on Saturday, Armagh have nine points while Tipperary are on eight. Ciaran McKeever hit Armagh\'s goal while Antrim had a CJ McGourty penalty saved as they stay in relegation trouble. Antrim will go into the final weekend of round robin games third from bottom but almost certainly needing a home victory over Longford to survive. McKeever netted as a close first half ended 1-3 to 0-6 before five points without reply saw Armagh surge clear. Antrim closed the gap to three points when McGourty\'s penalty was superbly saved by Armagh keeper Blaine Hughes. Saffrons pair Conor Murray and Stephen Beatty were red-carded late on along with Armagh\'s Stephen Sheridan. McKeever\'s goal was the highlight of a low-key first half between the Ulster rivals, with the centre half-forward palming in to finish a fine Orchard move. That gave Armagh a one-point lead after two CJ McGourty frees helped Antrim into an early advantage. Wasteful hosts McKeever slotted over the final score of the half to level but Armagh were guilty of wayward finishing, registering 11 wides in the opening 35 minutes. The side exchanged points on the restart and it was all-square before Armagh took charge. Unanswered points from Charlie Vernon (2), Aidan Forker, Jamie Clarke and Anto Duffy gave the hosts a five-point cushion. But Antrim showed resilience by hitting the next two points and then being awarded a penalty after a foul on Conor Murray. McGourty stepped up and his strike was kept out by an excellent save from Hughes in a decisive moment in the game. An unsavoury finale saw Murray, Sheridan and Beatty shown straight red cards for violent conduct in separate incidents while Armagh substitute Aidan Forker and Antrim\'s Conor Hamill were black-carded. Armagh secured a hard-fought win and they are a point clear of Louth and Tipperary although having played an additional game. Tipp task for Armagh Kieran McGeeney\'s team take on Tipperary in their final game as they chase promotion while Antrim are seventh to remain in relegation danger.\"We\'re delighted to get that victory and I\'m happy to make any contribution,\" said Armagh defender Vernon, who scored two points.\"Antrim were very good tactically and they deserve credit - they caused us problems on the counter-attack.\"We now face a big game against Tipperary and it\'s a major challenge for us before the championship.\" Cavan 1-10 0-13 KerryTyrone 0-12 1-10 MayoDonegal 1-11 1-11 MonaghanDerry 2-10 0-20 CorkMeath 3-15 0-6 FermanaghDown 1-13 3-15 GalwayKildare 0-18 1-14 ClareSligo 2-10 2-14 OffalyTipperary 0-12 0-16 LouthLeitrim 2-16 0-15 LondonWexford 0-9 3-24 WestmeathWicklow 0-10 1-18 CarlowDublin 2-29 0-14 RoscommonArmagh 1-12 0-13 AntrimLaois 1-13 0-13 LongfordWaterford 0-8 0-14 Limerick',sport
'Flawed nuclear tender sees £100m payout to firms Two US firms which lost out on a decommissioning contract to clean up 12 nuclear sites in the UK will receive £97. 5m compensation. The government has also ordered an inquiry into the \"deeply flawed\" tender. The £6. 1bn contract, awarded in 2014, is being terminated nine years early. The move hit shares in the UK engineering firm Babcock International, which headed the group that won the decommissioning deal. Flawed The compensation will go to Energy Solutions, which had previously managed the decommissioning sites, and another engineering firm, Bechtel. It follows a High Court ruling last July which found that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) had \"fudged\" the tendering process, wrongly deciding the outcome of the procurement process. Not only was the tender process flawed but the contract itself did not reflect the true extent of the work that had to be done, the court found. Babcock confirmed it had reached an agreement with the NDA to hand back the decommissioning contract early. The company said that the work required at the 12 sites was \"now materially different in volume to that which was initially specified\". Which nuclear plants are being decommissioned? England Berkeley, Bradwell, Dungeness A, Harwell, Hinkley Point A, Oldbury, Sizewell A, WinfrithWales Trawsfynydd, WylfaScotland Chapelcross, Hunterston AThe 14-year contract will now end in September 2019 after just five years. That will dent Babcock\'s annual revenue by £100m in 2020-21. The group said it would replace that with new business. Nonetheless, its shares were down more than 4\% in Monday trading after the news.\'Defective\' The independent inquiry, which will be led by the former chief executive of National Grid, Steve Holliday, will look at how the tender process was run and why the contract awarded proved unsustainable.\"It\'s clear the 2012 tendering process was deeply flawed,\" said the Business Secretary Greg Clark, responding to an urgent question in parliament.\"This was a defective procurement, with significant financial consequences, and I am determined that the reasons for it should be exposed and understood; that those responsible should properly be held to account; and that it should never happen again,\" Mr Clark also said. He added that workers at nuclear power stations at the heart of the failed decommissioning deal would not be under threat. According to the Department for Business, the inquiry will \"review the conduct of the NDA and of Government departments and make any recommendations it sees fit\". That could include possible disciplinary proceedings, it added. The inquiry is due to report in October. Trade unions have called for the decommissioning contract to be taken back from private companies. Unite national officer for energy, Kevin Coyne, said it was \"clear that the \'clean up\' contract should be taken back into public control where it should have been in the first place\". The GMB\'s Scotland Secretary Gary Smith described the 2014 deal as \"a mess from the off\". \"We need to cut out the middle men, have this work done in-house to cut costs and to save the taxpayer money,\" he said.

'The stars who can\'t escape their most famous roles It\'s every budding actor\'s dream - a starring role in a TV show or film that becomes a major hit. But then they try to move on - and find that their iconic character just won\'t let them. The latest actor to complain about being shackled to his famous alter ego is Alfonso Ribeiro. You may know him better as Will Smith\'s highfalutin cousin Carlton Banks from 1990s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. He\'s said being overshadowed by his character has \"stopped me from being able to be an actor\". The 45-year-old : \"It has forced ME to be my character, hosting game shows and America\'s Funniest Videos.\'I could be a deranged killer!\' \"I would like to try some stuff that is different from how the world sees me, just sink my teeth into… shoot, I could be a deranged killer! \"But I doubt someone would automatically think of me when they go, \'We need to cast a killer, let\'s get the dude who played Carlton.\'\"He did also say the role was \"rewarding in many ways\" - and you could argue that an actor is lucky to get one part in a hit show in their career. Here are some other actors who have found it impossible to leave their most famous parts behind - and some who have managed to reinvent themselves. Mark Hamill Perhaps the ultimate example of an actor known for one role, Hamill (above right) is and always will be Luke Skywalker. His non-Star Wars films remained relatively low-key so he went to Broadway, taking the title role in Amadeus in 1983. But when director Milos Forman made a big screen version, he is reported to have rejected Hamill, saying: \"I don\'t want Luke Skywalker in this film.\"Hamill got around the typecasting by becoming a successful voice actor, including as The Joker in the Batman animated series. Carrie Fisher The force also remained strong for Hamill\'s co-star, whose performance as Princess Leia became iconic. Fisher had other roles - like in When Harry Met Sally and Hannah and Her Sisters - and wrote novels. But being most closely associated with Leia had been \"great\".\"She\'s a very proactive character and gets the job done. So if you\'re going to get typecast as something, that might as well be it for me.\" James van der Beek Van Der Beek (second left) has struggled to shed the memory of teenage heart-throb Dawson, whose Creek was so admired by teen viewers from 1998-2003.\"It did hold me back,\" , adding that movie directors would think he was too recognisable and not take him seriously. \"But at the end of the day, it just makes you work that much harder.\"He has also parodied his own fame - even playing a bitter version of himself as an actor trying to revive his career in 2012 sitcom Don\'t Trust The B in Apartment 23. Jennifer Aniston This could apply to any of the cast of Friends to be honest. In fact, Aniston has arguably done better than the rest - she\'s been in lots of middle-ranking rom-coms and got a Golden Globe nomination for 2014 drama Cake. But who are we kidding - she\'s still Rachel.\"It\'s really hard to be cast in [a dramatic film like Cake],\" . Especially if \"you\'re someone who is battling a persona. Sometimes it\'s hard to disappear from it in a role.\"And sometimes it\'s hard to get away from a certain haircut. Christopher Reeve The star of the original four Superman movies in the 1970s and \'80s, Reeve later battled to \"escape the cape\". He took a wide variety of roles on film, TV and stage before a riding accident left him paralysed in 1995. Only his later real-life role as a campaigner for spinal cord injury research came close to eclipsing that of the Man of Steel. And a few who did escape the typecasting Will Smith Starring in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air didn\'t seem to hold Will Smith back. In fact, it led to a string of hit films including Bad Boys, Independence Day, Men in Black and Ali, not to mention two Oscar nominations. And, presumably to Ribeiro\'s chagrin, he has even played a killer - as Deadshot in Suicide Squad. Perhaps he should be typecast a bit more. He can do comedy, action or drama - as long as he\'s an indomitable, smart-talking, high-energy hero. Films where he plays more sombre roles tend to tank. Harrison Ford Having proved it possible to break out of the Star Wars universe, Harrison Ford isn\'t just the bloke who played Han Solo. Perhaps he was lucky in that he made two more major films - Raiders of the Lost Ark and Blade Runner - before The Return of the Jedi could trap him in that particular pigeonhole. Or perhaps there\'s another explanation - maybe he\'s a better actor than his Star Wars co-stars. Emma Watson Of the main Harry Potter cast, Emma Watson is probably the one where you think \"oh it\'s that one from Harry Potter\" least often. She\'s done a few half-decent grown-up films and we\'ll see how her biggest post-Potter movie, Beauty and the Beast, performs next week. But more than that - she\'s positioned herself as a serious social commentator. Daniel Radcliffe, too, is desperately trying to be a proper actor. But, perhaps because he played Harry himself, it might take a bit longer for us to shake off the image of the kid with wand and glasses.',entertainment
'Average English council tax bill to rise 4\% - survey Average council tax bills in England will rise by 4\% in April, reaching almost £1, 600 annually, a survey for public finance experts suggests. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy said households face the largest rise in a decade. There were 307 responses to its survey on bills for Band D properties, sent to all 420 English authorities. The government said council tax was expected to be lower at the end of this parliament in real terms than in 2010. There are eight different council tax bill bands, based on the value of the property. According to CIPFA, the above-inflation rise will take the average Band D bill across England to £1, 590. 53, an increase of £60. 94. It said the average increase includes contributions for police, fire, the Greater London Authority, and those without social care responsibilities. Authorities with responsibility for social care are permitted to raise bills by up to 4. 99\% without triggering a referendum. Smaller councils excluded from social care obligations can increase bills by up to 1. 99\%. CIPFA said its survey indicated that 70\% of the authorities responsible for social care were taking advantage of the The survey suggested among the authorities entitled to impose an additional social care precept - English counties, unitaries, metropolitan districts and London boroughs - the average increase on a Band D property would be 4. 3\%, 4. 8\%, 4. 9\% and 3. 9\% respectively. Sean Nolan, director for local government at CIPFA, said the expected rise in council tax bills comes after six years of very low increases. He said this was actively encouraged by the government, which had offered a grant if councils did not raise bills.\"The subsequent removal of this freeze grant shows a clear shift in public policy in general, but also a reflection of the strains being caused by social care pressures.\"A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said it had \"protected\" residents by allowing them to veto excessive rises at a referendum. He said a four-year funding settlement gives local authorities \"the certainty they need to plan ahead\", with almost £200bn being made available. He added: \"We\'ve also announced an additional £900m for social care, meaning councils will have £7. 6bn of dedicated funding to spend over this period.\"',politics
'Legal fight over $22. 5m gaming takeover deal Gaming veteran John Carmack is suing ZeniMax Media for $22. 5m (£18. 5m) which he claims the company has not paid him. He alleges the cash should have been handed over as part of the deal that saw ZeniMax take over id Software - the game studio Mr Carmack founded. In 2009, ZeniMax paid $150m to buy the studio, best-known for making the Doom and Quake series of games. In response to the lawsuit, ZeniMax said Mr Carmack\'s claim was \"completely without merit\". The lawsuit comes soon after ZeniMax won a $500m legal fight against Oculus - Mr Carmack\'s employer.

In 2011, Mr Carmack converted half of that settlement into shares of ZeniMax stock and says he expected the rest to be paid in cash. The legal papers allege that although the shares have been handed over, ZeniMax has not yet paid the remaining half of the settlement. The documents claim the delay is due to \"sour grapes\" on ZeniMax\'s behalf and asks the court to compel the company to pay up. After the sale of id Software, Mr Carmack stayed on as chief technology officer for 18 months before leaving to join virtual reality headset-maker Oculus in 2013.

'Newport County sack manager Graham Westley League Two strugglers Newport County have parted company with manager Graham Westley after five months in charge.

'Vehicle Excise Duty: Small car buyers face higher costs The way we pay road tax will change significantly from 1 April and it is something to consider if you\'re going to be buying a new car. Crucially, it is those buying cars with low CO2 emissions that face the highest relative rise in the tax. Currently many such vehicles don\'t incur the charges, known formally as Vehicle Excise Duty (VED). But for cars registered on or after 1 April 2017 there will be a first year of charges linked to carbon emissions. After that there will be three bands - zero, standard and premium - determining how much you will pay as a car owner each year. Importantly, if you have a car already, these rule changes do not apply and you will continue to pay VED under the existing rates. What are the changes? The changes, , reflect the fact that car manufacturers have cut many car models\' CO2 emissions. This means their owners benefit from the existing VED bands that tax lower-emissions vehicles more lightly. As more cars get cleaner, the existing rules have cut back the Treasury\'s income - hence these changes. From 1 April onwards, only newly registered cars with zero emissions will escape VED - so that means electric and hydrogen cars only. There is a sliding scale of charges for the first year of ownership and after that petrol or diesel vehicles are subject to a \"standard\" rate of £140 a year. For those buying cars costing more than £40, 000 there will be an additional £310 \"premium\" levy for the first five years of ownership. What about older vehicles? Cars registered before 1 April, 2017 are not affected by the VED changes - so for existing car owners, you will pay as before. If your car has an engine capacity of less than 1549cc (about 1. 5 litres), then you will still pay £145 (if you pay upfront). If you car has a bigger engine, then the annual charge is £235. Both these figures rise slightly if you pay in instalments. You can get a detailed breakdown . If your vehicle was registered after 1 March 2001, then it is emissions that determine how much you currently pay. Vehicles have to be in Band D (emitting 121-130g/km of CO2) before you pay any significant annual road tax - in the case of Band D it is £110 a year. What if I\'m buying a second-hand car? The VED changes do not apply to cars that are already on the road, so if you\'re buying a second-hand car then your vehicle will be taxed under the old system. However, one wrinkle to bear in mind is that since the end of the paper tax disc in 2014 it is no long possible to transfer this tax between car owners. As soon as the car is sold the seller should complete the \"new keeper\" bit of the car\'s registration document - the V5C certificate - and send it to the DVLA. You, as the new owner, keep hold of the green bit. You can tax the car immediately online or over the phone with the , or at a post office. The seller gets a refund of unused tax from the DVLA. Should I buy my new car now or wait until April? It all depends what type of car you are thinking of buying, but in general it is the most economical vehicles which face the biggest percentage rise in road taxes. For a small car like a Ford Fiesta 1. 0T Ecoboost with CO2 emissions of 99g/km, you pay no Vehicle Excise Duty if you buy before 1 April. If you buy after that you pay up to £120 in the first year and £140 annually thereafter. For a mid-range car, like the Honda Civic 1. 4 i-VTEC Sport, with a higher CO2 emissions figure of 131g/km you currently pay £130 in the first year and then a standard annual rate - also £130. If you buy on or after 1 April you\'ll pay £200 in the first year and £140 thereafter. For a top-end car like the Jaguar XE 2. 0i R-Sport with CO2 emissions of 179g/km you currently pay £355 in the first year and £230 after that. If you buy on or after 1 April you will pay £800 in the first year, but your annual bill will then come down to £140. I\'ve got an electric car or an alternative fuel car, what will I pay? From 1 April, only newly registered cars with zero emissions will escape VED - so that means electric and hydrogen cars only. Cars with low CO2 emissions of up to 100g/km will pay between £10-£120 in the first year. After the first year of registration, alternative fuel vehicles such as hybrids, or those using bi-ethanol and liquid petroleum gas will pay £130 a year. So if you are considering buying a low-emissions car using an alternative fuel, it may make sense to bring forward your purchase to March. What difference will this make to the car industry? The money raised for this will be paid into a roads fund to help towards the upkeep of the UK\'s motorway and roads network. Motoring groups have given a mixed reaction to the changes.\"While zero-emission cars will, on the whole, remain exempt from VED, the new regime will disincentivise take-up of low-emission vehicles,\" said Tamzen Isacsson of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). \"For example, new technologies such as plug-in hybrid - the fastest growing ultra-low emission vehicle segment - won\'t benefit from long-term VED incentive, threatening the ability of the UK and the automotive sector to meet ever stricter CO2 targets. \"The introduction of a surcharge on premium cars also risks undermining growth in UK manufacturing and exports, which helps to support some 814, 000 jobs in the UK.\" The RAC said that while costs would rise for many drivers, the fact that new car prices had been dropping in real terms over many years would help offset this. It also welcomed the fact that money raised from VED would be ring-fenced for road investments.',business
'Pussyhat goes on display at V&A A pink woollen \"pussyhat\" that was worn at the Women\'s March on Washington has gone on display at the V&amp; A in London. The hat was one of thousands donned at January\'s protest in response to Donald Trump\'s controversial 2005 comments about grabbing women \"by the pussy\". The garment forms part of the Victoria and Albert museum\'s Rapid Response collection of items reflecting current global and political events. It was knitted by Jayna Zweiman, co-founder of the Pussyhat project. The initiative aimed to turn the 21 January march into a \"sea of pink\" in protest against the Trump administration. Other marches that took place around the world also saw widespread use of the garment. According to the V&amp; A\'s Corinna Gardner, the hat became \"an immediately recognisable expression of female solidarity and symbol of the power of collective action\". Other items in the Rapid Response collection include a Vote Leave campaign leaflet distributed in the run-up to the UK\'s EU referendum.',entertainment
'Brexit: Government suffers second defeat in Lords The government has suffered a second Brexit defeat in the House of Lords as peers backed, by 366 votes to 268, calls for a \"meaningful\" parliamentary vote on the final terms of withdrawal. Ministers said it was disappointing and they would seek to overturn the move when the bill returns to the Commons. Lord Heseltine, one of 13 Tory peers to rebel, said he had been sacked as a government adviser on regional growth. The previous defeat was on the issue of guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens. Lord Heseltine, 83, who served as a minister in the Thatcher government, said he was informed by the Conservative chief whip in the Lords he was to be sacked \"from the five jobs with which I have been helping the government\". \"This is entirely the right of the prime minister and I\'m sorry that the expertise which I have put at the government\'s disposal over the last six years has now come to an end,\" he said.\"However, in the last resort, I believe, as I said in the House of Lords, the future of this country is inextricably interwoven with our European friends.\"It\'s the duty of Parliament to assert its sovereignty in determining the legacy we leave to new generations of young people.\"Lord Heseltine had been brought in by former Prime Minister David Cameron to advise the government on a range of projects, including schemes in east London and Swansea.\'Deal or no deal\' After a three-hour debate on Tuesday, for the second time in a week peers amended the legislation that will authorise Theresa May to notify the EU of the UK\'s intention to leave and pave the way for official Brexit talks to begin. The turnout in the Lords for the vote was the largest since 1831, according to Parliament\'s website. The amendment, which was carried by a majority of 98, would require the final terms of the UK\'s withdrawal from the EU to be put to separate votes in the Commons and the Lords. Some peers believe this would amount to a veto but ministers insist the UK would leave the EU anyway irrespective of whether it was approved or not. As well as Lord Heseltine, 12 other Tory peers defied the government to vote in favour of the amendment, including former ministers Lord Deben and Viscount Hailsham. The issue will now return to the Commons to be reconsidered by MPs, who have already rejected calls for the \"meaningful vote\" clause to be included in the legislation, saying verbal guarantees given by government on parliamentary scrutiny are sufficient. The BBC\'s political editor Laura Kuenssberg said ministers were adamant they wouldn\'t back down after the Lords defeat and it was genuinely hard to tell at this stage if MPs had the numbers in the Commons to defeat the government. Speaking in favour of the amendment, QC and crossbench peer Lord Pannick said it would enable Parliament to exercise some \"control\" over the process of withdrawal and fulfil its duty to properly scrutinise.\"It must be for Parliament to decide whether to prefer no deal or the deal offered by the EU,\" he said. \"It will guarantee that the government must come back to both Houses and seek approval for the result of negotiations.\"But government minister Lord Bridges said once Article 50 had been triggered, the process of leaving the EU was irrevocable and the amendment was totally unclear on what would happen if the UK and the EU were not able to agree a formal deal on the terms of exit.\"We will leave with a deal or we will leave without a deal. That is the choice on offer.\"\'Not in the dark\' Parliament, he insisted, would not be left \"in the dark\" during the two-year process and would be able to shape future legislation on the incorporation of EU law and potential changes to immigration rules. He also argued the amendment would tie Mrs May\'s hands and make her task in getting a good deal \"more difficult from day one\". Reacting to the defeat, Brexit Secretary David Davis suggested peers were threatening the UK\'s aim of getting negotiations under way as soon as possible. \"It is clear that some in the Lords would seek to frustrate that process, and it is the government\'s intention to ensure that does not happen,\" he said.\"We will now aim to overturn these amendments in the House of Commons.\"But Labour\'s Baroness Smith said that given the referendum campaign had been full of arguments about reasserting Parliamentary sovereignty, it was appropriate that Parliament should have the \"final say\" on the process. Lib Dems defeated And former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg urged MPs to \"find the nerve\" and ensure the requirement for a Parliamentary vote remained in the bill. \"I would urge MPs of all parties, including Brexiteers who campaigned to leave on the basis of parliamentary sovereignty, to stop Parliament being neutered.\"Parliament has a long history of ratifying treaties. What is the government scared of? If they cannot bring back a deal they are prepared to put before MPs, then it cannot be a deal that is good enough for Britain.\"Earlier, a Lib Dem amendment calling for a second referendum on the terms of exit was comfortably defeated by 336 votes to 131. Without a commitment to a second vote, the Lib Dems took the rare step of opposing the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill at its third and final reading although peers overwhelmingly approved the bill and sent it back to the Commons. Theresa May has said she wants to trigger Article 50 by the end of March but the Commons is unlikely to have an opportunity to consider the changes made by the Lords until the middle of next week as four days have been set aside for debate on the Budget.

'Canadian photographer \'sorry\' for explicit image sharing A Canadian photographer and comedian has admitted posting explicit images of women along with their names on controversial internet forum 4Chan. However, he denied doing so for \"malicious intent\" - a practice known as doxxing. Ren Bostelaar apologised for his actions but said the photos had already been posted elsewhere on the net by the women themselves. Toronto Police is investigating but no charges have been made. The allegations were made on social media by several women who claimed they were contacted by men after their photos and details appeared on 4Chan. Some of their stories date back to 2005, they claim. They say the images were never intended for public viewing and were shared in closed groups. It is unclear whether Mr Bostelaar was the original photographer. Under the it is illegal to distribute images \"knowing that the person depicted in the image did not give their consent to that conduct\".\'Deeply remorseful\' The photographer issued an apology on Facebook in which he described his behaviour as \"reprehensively bad\" but has since deleted all his social media accounts.\"Mr Bostelaar is deeply remorseful for his actions,\" said his lawyer Sam Goldstein in a statement. \"The photographs he re-posted were photographs that the women themselves had posted on the internet in public forums such as Facebook, Reddit, or Tumblr. \"He did not deliberately disseminate private details for malicious intent.\"Mr Goldstein added that \"not every personal moral failing requires judicial intervention\". Ren Bostelaar is one of the writers in a successful satire group called Stats Canada. The group tweeted to its 603, 000 followers that his behaviour was \"completely inexcusable\".',tech
'EFL: Five things you might have missed on Saturday A near six-year wait for a milestone goal was ended and a nine-minute hat-trick of penalties were scored on another busy Saturday of English Football League action. Elsewhere, the Championship leaders\' promotion march was stalled, a former England keeper made a landmark appearance and Stevenage again showed they are on the right road by beating Luton, neighbouring clubs whose homes are close to the A1 and M1. Here are five of the things you may have missed. Mackail-Smith hits his ton, at last When Craig Mackail-Smith scored his 99th Peterborough goal in the League One play-off final against Huddersfield at Old Trafford on 29 May 2011 to help secure promotion, he might not have expected the century to arrive nearly six years later. He finally hit that mark on Saturday, but unfortunately for Posh fans, the 33-year-old\'s 100th goal could not provide three points at home to Oxford, with his 91st-minute effort a mere consolation It has been quite the journey for the Scotland international in the 2, 113 days between those two goals, taking in spells with Brighton, Luton, and a brief and a previous goalless loan stay with Posh in 2014. With defeat leaving Peterborough eight points outside the play-off places with just nine games left to play, manager Grant McCann perhaps understandably did not enjoy the moment as much as he might have in more positive circumstances.\"He should have had a hat-trick today - Craig will probably tell you that himself,\" he told BBC Radio Cambridge.\"I\'m pleased he got the goal. Now he can forget about that and just concentrate on scoring goals again.\"Up until that point, he slashed at a couple of chances - and the one [he scored] he probably didn\'t mean, [although] he\'ll probably say he did, it was like a cross across the box, but they\'re the ones you need to get you up and running.\" Nine-minute penalty treble dents Iron Promotion-chasing Scunthorpe were cruising to victory at Gillingham in League One, until former Iron midfielder Josh Wright spoiled their day with a remarkable display of nerve and composure. Scunthorpe were 2-0 up with less than 15 minutes to go, before Wright stepped up to place the first of three penalties into the bottom right-hand corner. Two more spot-kicks followed, with Wright slotting the second into the bottom left-hand corner, and, after drawing a foul inside the box, he picked out the same spot again to complete and avenge a 5-0 thrashing at Scunthorpe back in August. The 27-year-old was presented with a match ball for his efforts, but he was also shown his 10th yellow card of the season for his celebrations following his third goal, meaning he will now serve a two-game ban.\"I promise you now, I didn\'t have any worries, because he\'s in good form and he\'s scoring goals for fun,\" manager Ady Pennock told BBC Radio Kent.\"I just knew that he was going to score all three because he\'s taken them before, and he practices in training as well.\"I just thought the ruling of him getting a yellow card after you score a hat-trick in the atmosphere that we had was very, very harsh.\"600 and counting Leeds United goalkeeper Rob Green turned 37 in January, but showed he is still going strong in his 600th league appearance. The former England international celebrated reaching the milestone with his 164th clean sheet in the league, this one against former club QPR at Elland Road. And there is no chance Green will be hanging up his boots any time soon.\"I feel good, I feel fit and I want to carry on playing,\" he told BBC Radio Leeds.\"I want to play games, I don\'t want to sit around and chill out for the rest of my career and pick up easy money doing not a lot.\"I want to be part of something that\'s interesting and exciting and this season\'s proving to be that.\"Unfortunately for Green, his efforts did not result in three points for Leeds, with leaving them 11 points outside the Championship\'s automatic promotion places. Unhappy anniversary for Rafa It has been an eventful 12 months for Rafael Benitez, who was unable to keep Newcastle in the Premier League last season, but has led them to the top of the Championship table. Sadly for the Spaniard, he was unable to celebrate his first anniversary as Magpies manager with a win, as they fell to at St James\' Park, with 16-year-old Ryan Sessegnon on the scoresheet twice for the Cottagers. Newcastle remain top of the Championship, but level on points with second-placed Brighton - and only six points clear of Huddersfield, who have a game in hand.\"Obviously, I\'m really disappointed because we knew that we needed to win to stay there with some points advantage and we didn\'t do it,\" Benitez told BBC Radio Newcastle.\"We knew that was a good team and we couldn\'t make mistakes, and we made mistakes and we paid for that.\"Stevenage complete double over rivals There was plenty more than local bragging rights at stake as Stevenage made the 15-mile journey to face Luton Town. Boro earned their first-ever home win over the Hatters in August, but were two points behind their play-off rivals before kick-off. Although could not add to his tally, Darren Sarll\'s side were still able to come out on top and complete the double, with Luke Wilkinson and Ben Kennedy getting the goals in There might yet be a chance for Luton to have the last laugh, as with both sides sitting comfortably in the play-off places, the pair could be battling it out once again for a place in League One in a couple of months\' time.',sport
'Next sees first annual profit fall in eight years Next has reported its first fall in annual profit for eight years and warned of \"another tough year ahead\". Pre-tax profit at dropped 5. 5\% from £836. 1m to £790. 2m last year. The firm, which had already warned profits would fall, said it remained \"extremely cautious\" about trading. It said shoppers were shifting their spending away from clothing, at the same time as inflation was rising and incomes were being squeezed. The profit drop in 2016 was the first for the retailer since the financial crisis of 2008. Despite the fall, investors sent Next shares 8\% higher on Thursday. Richard Hunter, head of research at Wilson King Investment Management, said investors were pleased with growth in the directory business and further details on a special dividend. Sales at Next\'s online and catalogue business rose 4\% to £1. 7bn. But the retailer said shoppers continued to shift away from the High Street, as sales at its bricks-and-mortar business fell 3\% to £2. 3bn. Next chairman John Barton said: \"Trading conditions in the year ahead will continue to be tough, however I believe that by focusing on our core strengths, as we did during 2008, we will see Next emerge from this period stronger than before.\"Retail \'malaise\' Next has \"had a remarkable record of out-performing its main competitors\", especially M&amp; S, in the past eight years, said Bryan Roberts of retail consultancy TCC Global. But the \"general malaise\" for retailers is now catching up with them, Mr Roberts told the BBC.\"We\'re spending less money on things and more on experiences or leisure,\" he said, adding that rising inflation and slowing growth in wages was also putting retailers under pressure. There was also a \"bit of an admission of guilt from Next\" that they were \"chasing the more fashionable end of the market and neglecting some of their core, mainstream ranges\", he said. Next said that by focusing energy on \"adopting exciting new trends\" it had omitted some of its \"best-selling, heartland product from our ranges\". It said this would improve in the summer ranges, but added \"we will not have our ranges where we want them until the autumn season\". \'Tough year\' Among the other challenges it was facing, Next warned that price inflation, which it attributed to the fall in sterling, might not ease until the second half of 2018. It also said that with more and more shoppers going online, it was \"legitimate to question the long term viability of retail stores\". Chief executive Lord Wolfson said: \"The year ahead looks set to be another tough year for Next.\"We remain clear on our priorities going forward. We will continue to focus on improving the company\'s product, marketing, services, stores and cost control.\"',business
'Is this the end of celebrity fragrances? One of the first things many of us notice when we meet someone is what sort of perfume or aftershave they\'re wearing. That was certainly the case when I met up with my friend Kerrie the other week and asked why she smelled of bliss on toast.\"Midnight Fantasy by Britney Spears,\" she replied. Now, I obviously appreciate Britney as pop royalty, but I was surprised such an arresting scent would have a celebrity\'s name attached to it. Not long ago, fragrances were associated with well-established, fashionable names such as Ralph Lauren or couture brands like Chanel. But the number of celebrity perfumes on the market has rocketed in the last decade. Why? Jennifer Lopez. \"Glow changed everything,\" says Chandler Burr, the former scent critic for the New York Times and author of several books on the subject. He credits Lopez\'s first fragrance, which was released in 2002, with triggering a deluge of deodorants.\"Elizabeth Taylor was one of the first [to have her own scent], but Glow kicked the whole thing into overdrive,\" he says. Lopez had sparked what brilliantly described as the \"scentocalpyse\". Suddenly, everyone and their goldfish had a scent of their own. And they sold by the truckload.\"Brands can see a huge surge in sales and awareness when a celebrity face resonates with their audience,\" says Gill Smith, managing director of The Perfume Shop. She cites Beyonce and Ariana Grande\'s ranges as some of the store\'s most popular products. So, what is the appeal of celebrity fragrances? \"Identification and intimacy,\" says Burr.\"Scent is an affordable unit of a star. Assuming the celebrity has actually been involved in its creation, a scent constitutes identification with that star viscerally and intimately. It is, in a small way, meeting them.\"Perfumes ideally have to match the celebrity\'s image while also appealing to their core audience (which explains why pop stars with younger fanbases have fragrances with sugary sweet smells). Smith says: \"We all still aspire to be more like our idols and connecting through a fragrance is one way of doing that. \"Britney Spears has stood the test of time. Diehard fans who wore Britney Fantasy over 12 years ago are still coming to us to try her new fragrances.\" This is probably a good moment for me to make a confession. And, before I start, it\'s not something I\'m proud of, ok? It was August 2014. I\'d been to Spain on holiday and was in the duty free section of Barcelona Airport. Early, bored and trying to get rid of the last of my euros, I was spraying various aftershaves up and down my arm when one caught my nose. I looked at the bottle and was surprised to see it was something called The Secret by Antonio Banderas. So I bought it, and was duly mocked by my friends for having spent money on something called The Secret by Antonio Banderas. But it did make me realise that, if something smells good, it will sell regardless. For celebrities who don\'t want to release a fragrance under their own name, the mere act of endorsing an existing brand can have a huge impact.\"Johnny Depp as the face of Dior Sauvage has helped to drive awareness for that fragrance,\" Smith says. \"Eighteen months after launch it\'s still one of our top 10 sales every day. \"Other examples include Gigi Hadid with Tommy Girl; Jared Leto with Gucci; and Estee Lauder Modern Muse with Kendall Jenner.\"She adds: \"More recently the announcement of Guerlain working with Angelina Jolie has given a more traditional fragrance house a celebrity boost.\"The stigma around celebrity fragrances may have faded over the last few years - but now the sales are fading as well. It\'s a decline that started several years ago in the US. \"We saw it in 2008 right after the crash, and it\'s now a given in the US industry that the celebrity market has collapsed - or at least hugely shrunk,\" Burr explains.\"Rihanna and a few others have scents that are doing well, but it\'s nothing like before.\"Consumers in the UK appear to be turning their noses up at them too. Figures released by market research group National Purchase Diary (NPD) show sales of celebrity fragrances declined by £12m in the UK last year - a drop of 22\%. But the fragrance market as a whole actually by 1. 4\% - so it\'s not that people stopped buying perfume, just that they\'re less drawn to celebrities. Just look at the sales of couture brands like Prada, Chanel and Dior, which collectively saw a 6\% increase last year. \"The decline in celebrity perfumes is something we noticed in the past two years - it\'s not something we see normally,\" says Teresa Fisher, senior account manager in UK Beauty at NPD. That drop, she points out, could partly be down to fewer launches.\"The market was very healthy a few years ago because there were a lot of celebrity fragrances around,\" Fisher says.\"We saw One Direction and James Bond scents generate market growth, but now we aren\'t seeing as many celebrity launches.\" There might be fewer celebrities cologne-ising the shelves (sorry), but Smith says the market is still strong.\"It\'s definitely not the end of celebrity fragrance, we do still believe there is a place in the market for them,\" she says. \"Customers still want celebrity perfumes as long as it is the right celebrity, and the right scent.\"The right scent, of course, is the crucial part. When he was the NYT\'s scent critic, Burr famously Britney\'s Midnight Fantasy four stars, implying there should be no snobbery about celebrities if the smell itself is good. He cites Sarah Jessica Parker\'s Lovely as one of the best of the celebrity fragrances he came across and is now even developing his own, called You or Someone Like You. Fisher says: \"I think overall what we\'re seeing is the polarisation of the fragrance market.\"At one end, consumers look for value for money, they go for promotions and maybe celebrity fragrances. But at the other, consumers are becoming more selective. \"Rather than buying 10 times a year maybe they buy five times a year. They\'re spending the same amount of money but going towards a more niche or premium offering.\"The fragrance industry was worth £1. 25bn in the UK last year, and shows no signs of slowing any time soon. But if the current sales trends continue, there could well be far fewer famous faces plastered across perfumes in the future. Expect your next birthday present to be a bottle of Jean Paul Gaultier rather than Justin Bieber. Audrey Hepburn and Joan Crawford famously endorsed fragrances by Givenchy and Estee Lauder respectively, while Catherine Deneuve became the face of Chanel no 5 in the 1970s Sophia Loren was one of the first to have a fragrance of her own - releasing Sophia by Coty in 1981 Elizabeth Taylor later released her own range of perfumes, and her 1991 White Diamonds scent went on to become the of all time But Jennifer Lopez\'s Glow, released in 2002, was a turning point - inspiring hundreds of famous faces to get in on the act The trend made its way to the UK, with British celebrities such as David Beckham, Alesha Dixon, Little Mix and Tulisa all releasing their own fragrances. In 2016, celebrity fragrances made up 4\% of the prestige fragrance market, with fashion brands like Boss or Armani making up 53\% and around a third coming from couture brands like Chanel or Prada ',entertainment
'Swansea city deal could be signed this month, says Philip Hammond A £1. 3bn investment deal for Swansea and south west Wales could be agreed by 27 March, the chancellor has said. Supporters of the proposed Swansea Bay Region city deal were disappointed that it was not included in Philip Hammond\'s Budget on Wednesday. He told Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards in a letter he was \"over-optimistic\" to say the deal might be ready so soon. Mr Edwards warned it would be deferred until after May\'s local elections if it is not agreed \"in the next few days\". The proposals aim to create thousands of jobs in Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire and Swansea. In his letter to Carmarthen East and Dinefwr MP Mr Edwards, Mr Hammond wrote: \"My understanding is that the negotiations are aiming to conclude the deal by March 27, when the local election purdah period begins [when rules limit government activity during the campaign].\"The UK government\'s adviser on the deal, former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine, was sacked earlier this week but ministers say that won\'t affect the deal.

He told The Wales Report, on BBC One, there were some things that needed to be \"tweaked\".\"There are some issues that need to be tweaked and improved but I am confident that we will have a good deal for Swansea which shows that Westminster not only delivers for the capital city of Wales but also for Wales\' second city.\"He added: \"I am confident that we will also have a .\"Cllr Rob Stewart, leader of Swansea council, said the deal would \"improve people\'s lives\" by generating up to 10, 000 jobs and investing in technology.',politics
'Amazon hands over Echo \'murder\' data Amazon has agreed to hand over data from an Amazon Echo that may have been operating as an alleged murder took place, after the defendant consented. The technology giant had argued that it was against customer privacy. Victor Collins was found dead in a hot tub in Arkansas in November 2015. His friend James Andrew Bates denies murdering him. Prosecutors think the Echo may have captured fragments of audio from the scene as it listened for commands. The \"always on\" Echo speaker makes recordings of audio it hears from a fraction of a second before it detects a wake word - either \"Alexa\" or \"Amazon\" - and that data goes to Amazon\'s servers. One witness said music had been streaming from the device during the evening. Mr Bates says he was asleep at the time, and the data may hold clues as to who was with Mr Collins when he died.

'IOC board member apologises \'unreservedly\' for Holocaust comparison An International Olympic Committee (IOC) board member has apologised for comparing calls to ban Russia from the 2018 Winter Olympics to the Holocaust. Gian-Franco Kasper, a Swiss ski official, made the comparison during an IOC board meeting in Pyeongchang. The board is debating whether to suspend the entire Russian team from the Games \"I apologise unreservedly for any offence I have caused. I am truly sorry,\" Franco Kasper said. The International Ski Federation President was discussing a proposed blanket ban on Russian athletes when he made the Holocaust comment, referring to the World War II genocide that saw six million Jews killed by Adolf Hitler\'s Nazi Germany. He \"I\'m just against bans or sanctioning of innocent people. Like Mr Hitler did - all Jews were to be killed, independently of what they did or did not do.\"When challenged by reporters at the time, Franco Kasper responded: \"Why not? Of course it\'s more extreme. But just the fact that the place you come from makes you guilty, I\'m not OK for this, really not.\"Russia did not receive a blanket ban from the IOC from the 2016 Olympics in Rio, opting to leave the decision to individual sports\' governing bodies.

'Record numbers rely on parental cash to buy a property The number of first-time buyers relying on the \"bank of mum and dad\" for financial help has hit a record high, according to new research. Analysis for the Social Mobility Commission suggests that more than a third of homebuyers in England depend on money from their family. Using the latest official data available, from 2013-14, researchers found 34\% of buyers needed cash or a loan from their parents. That compared with just 20\% in 2010/11. A further 10\% of buyers relied on inherited wealth, the research found. \"Affordability problems mean that parents and other family members have a critical role in assisting their children to buy their first home, either by means of a gift of money or a soft loan,\" said the report author, Dr Paul Sanderson from Anglia Ruskin University. The issue has already been highlighted by the insurance company Legal and General, which said that in the UK last year were part-funded by parents. It said that the average amount given was £17, 500. \'Exacerbating inequality\' The research also said that home ownership among young families was \"in free fall\". It found that in 1990, as many as 63\% of 25-29 year-olds owned their own properties. By 2015, that proportion had fallen to 31\%. in December last year found that just 20\% of 25-year-olds now own a house or flat. The average cost of a home bought by a first-time buyer in England and Wales is now just under £200, 000, according to the Land Registry. Alan Milburn, a former Labour health secretary and now chair of the Social Mobility Commission, said: \"Home ownership helps unlock high levels of social mobility, but it is in free-fall among young families. \"The way the housing market is operating is exacerbating inequality and impeding social mobility.\" But he welcomed government recognition of the problem. Under the Starter Homes programme, buyers aged between 23 and 40 will be able to buy homes at a 20\% discount to the market value. The initiative, brought in by former prime minister David Cameron, will start in 30 areas of England and will apply to homes up to £250, 000 in value, or £450, 000 in London. As discussed in February\'s , the government also wants councils to develop more specific housing plans, to encourage smaller developers to build houses, and to allow more vertical building in urban areas.

The veteran natural history expert has narrated Attenborough\'s Adventures, a five-part series of animated stories for the CBeebies Storytime app. The interactive tales follow Sir David from Zoo Quest in the 1950s to 2016\'s Attenborough and the Giant Dinosaur. Sir David said he was \"thrilled\" by the project. \"We\'ve brought to life many fond memories of my exploration of the natural world for young children to enjoy and learn,\" said Sir David. The series is designed to help teach children up to the age of six how to read, and begins on Friday with a story called Gorilla Quest. It\'s based on the \"aah\"-inducing moment from 1979\'s Life on Earth, which saw Sir David sit with a baby jungle gorilla which had climbed onto his lap. David and the Gorilla Quest David and the Giant Dinosaur David and the Hidden City David and the Dragon David the Treasure Hunter Children can play and become involved in the story by doing things like helping the young explorer pack his kit and clearing his jungle path. Four more stories will be released with Sir David going in search of dinosaurs, dragons - and a hidden city.

'Jones: Leader change \'last thing needed\' during Brexit First Minister Carwyn Jones has said he has given \"no thought\" to standing down, and there is a \"lot of work to do\" over the UK leaving the EU. It has been suggested he would quit before the 2021 assembly election. But Mr Jones told BBC Wales a change of Welsh Government during Brexit was \"the last thing that should happen\". At the party\'s Welsh conference, Shadow Welsh Secretary Christina Rees praised Labour councils\' record, but said May\'s local elections would be \"tough\". She was speaking on the final day of the conference in Llandudno on Sunday. Speaking from the event, Bridgend AM Mr Jones told the programme there was a \"lot of work to do\" over leaving the European Union.\"I just turned 50,\" he said. \"I\'m still much younger than Theresa May, younger than David Cameron.\"There\'s a lot of work to do particularly with Brexit.\"I\'m still as enthusiastic as I ever was, and I\'ve given no thought as to when I stand down.\" Mr Jones, who became Labour leader in 2009, said: \"What I\'m absolutely focused on now is delivering the best deal for Brexit.\"The last thing that should happen is for there to be a sudden change in government in Wales or for anywhere else for that matter.\"We need to make sure that people who have been there for a while who\'ve seen what\'s happened in the past - and I know I\'m the longest serving head of government in the UK - then we can get a the point where we have not a hard Brexit, not a soft Brexit, but a sensible Brexit.\"The conference later backed a call to formalise Mr Jones\'s role as Welsh Labour leader, in a vote delayed from Saturday after a problem with voting cards. Until now, although he has been described as Labour leader in Wales, his official title was leader of the party\'s assembly group.\'Tough\' Making her first speech to the conference as shadow Welsh secretary, since being appointed by Jeremy Corbyn in February, Ms Rees said she understood how important councillors were.\"You deliver public services in a climate where the UK Tory government has slashed the Welsh Assembly\'s block grant,\" she said \"In spite of brutal Tory cuts from Westminster, our Labour councils have a proud record of delivery across Wales. \"Our Welsh Labour government has supported local authorities across the country and each Welsh Labour council has worked hard to maintain vital local services, invest in regeneration, and to provide buildings and facilities that are fit for the future.\"Calling the local elections on 4 May \"tough\" for the party, Ms Rees said she was being \"positive\" about them.

'Sony plans to let PC owners play PS4 games Sony has announced plans to let PC owners play PlayStation4 (PS4) games on their home computer. It announced the extension to its PlayStation Now streaming service but gave no date for when the games would be available. It said it would start small-scale trials with some games over the \"next few weeks\". Many people already use PlayStation Now to stream older PS3 games to the newer PS4 console and to PCs. Speed test Brian Dunn, a spokesman for Sony, said in the blog that a standard subscription for PlayStation Now would include access to the PS4 games. In the UK, a subscription costs £12. 99, and in the US $19. 99. Mr Dunn did not give any details about which titles would be available first via the streaming service. Currently, 483 older PlayStation games are accessible via the Sony service. Brendan Caldwell, writing on the Rock, Paper, Shotgun website, said many gamers were keen to try out PlayStation exclusives such as Resogun, Bloodborne, The Order: 1886 and Horizon: Zero Dawn. \"However, it\'s unlikely that all of these are going to be available straight away,\" , \"but those which were released early in the machine\'s life will probably appear.\"Mr Caldwell cautioned gamers to try the service before they took up a subscription, as it requires fast net-connection speeds to work well. Sony recommends a minimum broadband speed of 5Mbps for the service. Mr Dunn said invitations to the tests and trials would be going out to a few active subscribers soon.',tech

Martin believes Scotland\'s failure to reach Euro 2016 was partly to blame for the side\'s poor start to World Cup qualifying.\"I think the disappointment of not qualifying when we played so well for the majority of the campaign and one result probably cost us really,\" said the Norwich City player.\"That\'s disappointing for people and it\'s difficult to take, and we have maybe not got over that quickly enough.\"Performances haven\'t been terrible, but there\'s no one reason - if there had been one reason, we would have rectified it.\"Strachan\'s future will again be in the spotlight should the Scots fail to win, but Martin says the players still back the former Celtic and Southampton boss.\"We are still working hard and everybody still believes in what the manager wants to do,\" the 31-year-old said. \"Everyone enjoys working for him, everyone likes him and we need to make sure we show that on Sunday and put in a performance that makes sure there are no question marks about where we\'re moving and where we\'re heading in the campaign.\"We\'ve changed the way we are playing a little bit because the squad\'s changed and we are still working hard.\"But the most important thing is, regardless of what\'s gone on in the last three or four games of this campaign, if we win on Sunday, we are right back in the mix and we\'ve got a right chance of moving up the group and qualifying.\"We need a little spark in this campaign and hopefully Sunday will be it.\"',sport
'MPs debate £1, 200 cap on insurance costs for young drivers MPs are debating whether car insurance costs for young people between the ages of 18 and 25 should be capped at £1, 200 a year. It follows an online petition that was signed by 185, 000 people. So-called e-petitions that attract more than 100, 000 signatures have to be considered for a debate in Parliament. It comes on the day that car insurance premiums are expected to start rising, as a result of a government decision to The changes mean that insurers will have to pay out more to accident victims, which in turn means they are expected to increase premiums. \'Ridiculous\' 19 year-old Rhys Parker, who started the e-petition, said that insurance companies were making it harder and harder for people aged 18-25 years of age to start driving. The teenager, from Lowestoft in Suffolk, said he was quoted £2, 500 for his first year of driving, but eventually managed to get it for £1, 400.\"That\'s very much basic insurance,\" he told the BBC. \"I think it\'s ridiculous. Young people just don\'t get the help they need.\"MPs were recently told that the average premium for a 17 to 20-year-old driver is £3, 878 a year. E-petition debates are for discussion only, so MPs will not have the power to introduce any limit on premiums. The debate will be opened by Steve Double, the Conservative MP for St Austell and Newquay.\"I don\'t support the cap, but I do think we should be doing more to help young people,\" he said.\"The reason premiums are high is that young people have far more accidents.\" In response to the petition, the government said that would result in lower premiums. It also advised consumers to shop around, and to take advantage of companies that install black boxes under the bonnet. The boxes give insurance companies more data on driving patterns and can lead to reduced premiums for safer drivers. Government review Accountancy firm PwC has estimated that the average cost of car insurance could rise by between £50 and £75 a year as a result of the changes to injury compensation rules, with young people having to pay up to £1, 000 extra. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) that premiums would begin to rise from Monday, with two further waves of increases expected in July 2017 and January 2018. The government has promised to review the new injury compensation rules as a matter of urgency. ',business
'Beauty and the Beast release postponed in Malaysia The release of Disney\'s Beauty and the Beast has been postponed in Malaysia. The much-anticipated film sparked controversy last week after it emerged it would feature a \"gay moment\". It was due for release in Malaysia on Thursday, but Disney said it was being held for a \"review\" of its content. The Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) said on Tuesday it had approved the screening but with \"a minor edit concerning a gay moment in the film\". Homosexual activity is illegal in Muslim majority Malaysia, although the country\'s tourism minister has said banning the film is \"ridiculous\". A new release date has yet to be announced. The live-action remake was granted a \"P13 parental guidance classification\". \"We have approved the film so there is no more issue. Once a film receives approval, it means it can be screened,\" LPF Chairman Datuk Abdul Hamid said.\"However, the date of screening and where the screening takes place is not under LPF\'s jurisdiction. We only look at the content and give a decision on whether the movie gets approved or not.\" Local cinema chains have been offering refunds for customers who have purchased tickets in advance. Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon has spoken about the in the film. It involves LeFou - the sidekick of the film\'s main antagonist Gaston - who tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between lust and admiration, as a side-plot to the main story. The decision to review the Disney classic in Malaysia courted criticism from netizens, many of whom called it \"stupid and laughable\". \"Malaysia bans \'Beauty and the Beast\' but is okay with nonsense Malay movies with no moral values, just full of brainless jokes,\" wrote a Twitter user in which drew more than 4, 500 re-tweets. ‏ wrote: \"Malaysia has so many things to improve on but we choose to look at petty stupid stuff like banning Beauty and the Beast. How disgusting.\" Tourism minister Seri Nazri Aziz also said banning the film was \"ridiculous\".\"You don\'t ban a film because of a gay character. There are also gays in the world. I don\'t think it is going to influence anyone. We need to think, we must allow people to decide for themselves,\" he told the Malay Mail. In neighbouring Singapore, where sex between men is technically illegal, the Anglican Church has to parents over the film. Bishop Rennis Ponniah said Disney films were \"usually associated with wholesome, mainstream values\" but that parents were \"strongly advised to provide guidance to their children\" about the film. Last week, a Russian MP petitioned Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky to ban the film over the inclusion of a gay character but the country\'s culture ministry granted permission to screen the film, with a 16+ age rating. A Russian law prohibits the spreading of \"gay propaganda\" among minors. Emma Watson plays Belle, the young girl who falls in love with a monstrous beast with a dark secret. Her suitors - the Beast and Gaston - are played by British stars Dan Stevens and Luke Evans. The film opens in the UK on Friday.',entertainment
'The place where businesses and their office workers vote On a warm Saturday afternoon in March a group of campaigners heads to the Golden Lane estate in central London. Local council elections are just days away but these volunteers are not seeking votes on behalf of councillors. The members of the campaign group We Can Win want to make sure that residents are aware of the unique way that their local authority is elected. It is an electoral system that they object to. The City of London Corporation covers the so-called Square Mile, which is London\'s financial centre, and is distinct from the Greater London Authority which covers the whole of the UK capital. The City has a residential population of less than 8, 000 but around 450, 000 people work there - and the City Corporation enables a proportion of those workers to vote for councillors too, taking the electorate to almost 19, 000. The campaigners \"I was under the impression, in its simplest form, democracy was about one person one vote,\" says campaign director Dan Firth.\"But in the City of London Corporation elections, businesses have almost double the votes of ordinary people and to me that feels like an injustice.\"We Can Win is targeting the City elections with two main aims: to oppose what it sees as votes for big business and to maximise the number of residents who turn out and vote. The City is divided into 25 wards with residents mainly concentrated in just four of them: Portsoken, Queenhithe, Aldersgate and Cripplegate, which includes Golden Lane. Each ward is represented by Common Councillors and an alderman. Elections for Common Councillors take place every four years, with the next election on 23 March, while aldermen are elected at least every six years as their terms expire. The residents \"Some residents I spoke to were already aware of how the voting system worked,\" says campaigner Georgia O\'Brien. \"But those who didn\'t know were shocked. When I explained that workers had almost double the number of votes as residents, they just looked utterly defeated.\"Golden Lane resident Beverley Bytheway is active in the residents\' association yet unaware that workers as well as residents get a vote. The road straddles the border with the London Borough of Islington and she thought that both councils were elected in the same way. She is not a fan of the Corporation: \"If they could offload the residents, they would... they\'re really not interested.\"Electoral system Despite an apparent lack of awareness among some residents, the City of London Corporation is quite open about its system of elections and its website contains information on how to register to vote as a resident or as a worker.\"The City is a democratic institution,\" insisted a spokesman. \"All of its councillors are elected.\"For residents, it is one person, one vote but for businesses the number of votes depends on the number of employees. Sole traders and businesses with up to nine employees get one vote, while organisations with up to 50 staff can appoint one voter for every five people who work there. Organisations with more than 50 staff can appoint 10 voters and then one voter per 50 voters after that. The City\'s spokesman added: \"As the local authority we provide public services to both 7, 400 residents and 450, 000 City workers. Therefore to reflect the needs of the workers who come to the City each day, businesses located in the City can appoint people to vote in our local elections.\"The votes allocated to a business are proportional to their number of employees - the first 50 staff entitles a business to appoint 10 voters, but every additional 50 members of staff only entitle it to appoint an extra one voter, so the largest firms do not dominate the list of voters as they could do if it was a simple proportional representation of their workforce size.\"In its advice to firms wanting to sign up staff as voters, the Corporation says: \"It is important that people nominated to vote reflect the make-up of the organisation as a whole - from chief executive to entry-level employees and even regular contractors - so that the City Corporation represents the full range of the City\'s workforce. Voters nominated should reflect the whole diversity of an organisation\'s employees, including gender, ethnicity and seniority.\"The big business Professional services giant Deloitte employs over 10, 000 staff and has 260 voters across two wards. A spokesperson said: \"We value the votes we have in the City of London. The City does have an unusual electoral system due to its high number of workers and small residential population, but there are many local issues that Deloitte people care greatly about.\"For example, a thousand Deloitte people cycle into work every day. Their safety and the safety of all road users in our neighbourhood is important to us.\"The councillors provide a very valuable link between Deloitte and our neighbours - other businesses and local residents.\"A long history Local government in the City of London can be traced back to medieval times. It is the oldest local authority in Britain and a contender for the oldest continuing authority in the world. Non-residential votes in other council areas were abolished in 1969 but the system continued for the City Corporation. The current electoral system dates from an act of Parliament in 2002, which extended voting rights to companies limited by guarantee and increased the business vote. Boundary changes followed, which reduced the number of councillors. The City of London in numbers Permanent residents: 7, 400 (2011 Census) People who work in the City: 450, 000 (Source: City of London Corporation) Number of registered voters: 18, 983 (Source: City of London Corporation) Council wards: 25 Common Councillors: 100 Aldermen: 25 Lord Mayor chosen from amongst the aldermen The City is known for its financial institutions but bodies qualifying for a vote include shops, bars, restaurants, charities and even churches and hospital trusts. The small trader Tobacconist Mukesh Gaglani has been a registered voter in the City for 25 years. As a small business owner with two part-time employees, he gets one vote.\"You have a say in the progress of the City,\" he tells me, adding that he does not feel that big business dominates.\"As far as I\'m concerned, my vote is the same as anyone else\'s. You don\'t feel like you are in a minority.\"What is his response to proposals that only residents should be allowed to vote?\"I don\'t think it\'s appropriate. The City gets most of its revenue from commercial properties.\"So how does being elected by workers as well as residents affect the job of a councillor? The councillor Sophie Fernandes has served as one of four independent Common Councillors representing Coleman Street ward since 2009.\"I get queries about rubbish collection, I get queries about the ease with which people get to work, about infrastructure,\" she says, adding: \"The City of London is also a landlord. It owns a few buildings in my ward. I have complaints just like any other landlord has.\"When asked how many residents her ward has, she can think of just four, two of whom moved out temporarily as a consequence of work on London\'s Crossrail transport project.\"We try to break up the wards, depending on whether it\'s a business vote or a residential vote, so that we can concentrate on the needs of that particular ward, because the needs of residents and businesses are very different,\" she says.\"It is workers who have a vote, it\'s not businesses who have a vote,\" she says. She adds: \"I don\'t think every worker should have a vote because it would completely outweigh residents but in wards such as mine, it is heavily business orientated without residents, so how would you represent this ward otherwise?\"What does she make of the allegation of Golden Lane resident Beverley that the City Corporation would rather be rid of its residential population?\"That\'s totally untrue. The residents bring diversity to the City.\"To stand as a councillor you need to be a registered voter and a Freeman of the City of London. \"If you are voter in the City then you can get freedom without cost, so there is no barrier to standing,\" Ms Fernandes says. Party politics Like nearly all councillors at present, she sits as an independent and does not take a party whip. She is standing this time on a slate alongside fellow independents Michael Cassidy, Stuart Fraser and Andrew McMurtie and argues that being independent helps the City work with both a Conservative government and a Labour mayor of London.\"We do not want party politics,\" she says. \"I fail to see the benefit that party politics will bring when you can still argue your point of view from an independent platform.\"That view is being challenged by the Labour Party, which first ran candidates in 2009 and is contesting wards in 2017. Paul O\'Brien, who is contesting Coleman Street for the party, claims that there is an \"urban myth of independents in the City\". He argues that many councillors list party memberships in their declarations of interests but only Labour openly fields candidates. A resident of the City himself, Mr O\'Brien nevertheless agrees with Sophie Fernandes on the need for worker representation.\"Clearly there are wards with no, or virtually no residents, so there needs to be a different system,\" he says. Both opponents and supporters of the voting system agree that the City of London is an unusual organisation with a reach stretching well beyond the Square Mile. It owns and maintains housing estates and open spaces across Greater London and beyond, including Hampstead Heath and Epping Forest, and provides money to London boroughs though its City Bridge Trust. The elections for the City of London\'s Common Councillors take place on Thursday 23 March - ',politics
'WhatsApp\'s privacy protections questioned after terror attack Chat apps that promise to prevent your messages being accessed by strangers are under scrutiny again following last week\'s terror attack in London. On Sunday, the home secretary said the intelligence services must be able to access relevant information. Her comments followed the discovery that Khalid Masood appeared to have used WhatsApp minutes before carrying out his killings. There are doubts about whether that action was related to the atrocity. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw has highlighted that the police had declared that they believed Masood had acted alone on the day, and would not have done so unless they had accessed and read messages stored on his phone. Even so, the home secretary has summoned WhatsApp\'s owner, Facebook, and other technology companies to a meeting on Thursday to discuss ways to ensure that security officers get the data they need in the future. What has this got to do with encryption? Several chat apps have adopted a technique called end-to-end encryption. This digitally scrambles their messages\' contents when it leaves a sender\'s device, and then reassembles it on the recipient\'s computer using a shared key. The technology company running the service is not made privy to the key, so is unable to make sense of the conversation even though it passes through its computer servers. Some apps, including WhatsApp, Apple\'s iMessage, Signal and Threema, use end-to-end encryption by default. Others, such as Telegram, Line and Google\'s Allo, offer it as an option. If end-to-end encryption is active, the technology company running the app is limited in what useful information it can remotely disclose. But if a phone, tablet or PC is not passcode-protected - or if the authorities find a way to bypass the code - the physical device itself will provide access. Does that mean the technology companies have made it impossible for themselves to help investigators? Not necessarily. When someone sends or reads a message, they generate what\'s known as \"metadata\" - information about their interaction that is distinct from the chat\'s contents. This can include: the time a message was written the telephone number or other ID of the person it was sent to the physical locations of the sender and recipient at the time WhatsApp has shared such details with law enforcement officers in the past and has said it has been co-operating with authorities over last week\'s incident. In addition, if Apple users subscribe to the company\'s iCloud Backup service, the firm may be able to recover messages copied to its servers for safe-keeping and it has co-operated with investigators in the past. What more does the government want? It is not exactly clear. The Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, told the BBC that chat apps must not \"provide a secret place\" for terrorists to communicate, and that when a warrant had been issued, officers should be able to \"get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp\". On Sky News, that she supported end-to-end encryption as a cybersecurity measure, but said it was \"absurd to have a situation where you can have terrorists talking to each other on a formal platform... and it can\'t be accessed\". How this would work in practice is uncertain. WhatsApp, for example, does not store messages on its servers after they have been delivered. So, even if there was a way to retrospectively unencrypt the chats, it is unclear how this would work without significant changes to its systems. At one point, there had been speculation that the Investigatory Powers Act - which came into effect last year - might ban chat app\'s use of end-to-end encryption outright. Instead, it stated that technology companies could be compelled to \"provide a technical capability\" to remove \"electronic protection\" within their products - to mean app-makers might be compelled to secretly create backdoors or other security weaknesses to let messages be unscrambled. Why might technology companies resist? Files leaked by rogue US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden and Wikileaks suggest that even the most closely guarded hacking secrets can be revealed. And even if the tech companies did not share the technical details of the backdoors with the authorities - instead limiting themselves to passing on unscrambled chats - the very fact vulnerabilities existed means someone else might sniff them out. As a consequence, public trust in their software might be undermined.\"The encryption debate always rages after a terror incident, regardless of how effective backdoors would have been,\" said security consultant Troy Hunt.\"Even if, say, the UK was to ban encryption or mandate weaknesses be built into WhatsApp and iMessage, those with nefarious intent would simply obtain encryption products from other sources. \"These responses are kneejerk reactions by those who have little understanding of the efficacy and implications of what they\'re actually proposing.\"The TechUK lobby group said other hacking powers and a move to make internet providers keep a record of their customers\' internet habits - which were also outlined in the Investigatory Powers Act - meant counter-terrorism officers already had strong powers to tackle threats.\"From storing data on the cloud to online banking to identity verification, end-to-end encryption is essential for preventing data being accessed illegally in ways that can harm consumers, business and our national security,\" said its deputy chief executive, Antony Walker.',tech
'Warren Joyce: Wigan Athletic part company after four months Championship strugglers Wigan Athletic have parted company with boss Warren Joyce after only four months. The Latics at home to fellow relegation candidates Bristol City on Saturday to leave them four points from safety with nine games remaining. Former Manchester United Under-21 manager Joyce, 52, in November after Gary Caldwell\'s sacking but only won six of 24 games in charge. Assistant manager Graham Barrow will take charge for the rest of the season.\"It is unfortunate that we have made this decision but with the team in such a perilous position in the league, we need to act now because we cannot afford to fall any further behind,\" said \"Results and performances have simply not been up to standard often enough in recent matches.\"Although we acknowledge the difficulties faced in managing a team in a league where we are competing against clubs with much larger budgets, the nature of some of our recent defeats, especially against close rivals, has fallen short in terms of what we as a club, and all our supporters, expect.\"Former Bolton, Preston, Plymouth, Burnley and Hull City midfielder Joyce signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Wigan, but has left along with first team coach Andy Welsh. After winning the League One title last season, the Latics have struggled in the second tier, and are the lowest scorers, having failed to find the net in 10 of their last 14 home matches. Barrow, 62, is a former Wigan midfielder and manager who returned to the club in 2009 to work as a coach under Roberto Martinez. Analysis It\'s not altogether surprising, although it\'s still something of a shock when it happens. But the record under Warren Joyce has been miserable after the highs of last season when the \'Tics lifted the League One title. Next to bottom, four points from safety, just five wins in 22 league games, and with a dozen defeats tells its own story. Even bottom club Rotherham United have scored more goals. It\'s been even more painful at home with just one league win at the DW, not even finding the net in eight of the eleven league matches there on his watch. The effort has been there, but the quality of the football has been uninspiring. Maybe it was always the wrong fit. Running a successful production line of young players at Old Trafford doesn\'t automatically give you the nous to battle it out in with more experienced rivals in football\'s second tier against more established clubs with largely bigger budgets. Many will now question the wisdom of sacking Gary Caldwell in the autumn, six months after he was crowned League One Manager of the Season in his first year in management. He\'d only lost once in his last five games in charge after all.',sport
'Brexit: Food chiefs warn on EU tariffs Farmers, supermarkets and food suppliers have called on Theresa May to secure a free trade deal with the European Union after Brexit.

Separately, the EEF engineering group said a deal needed to be struck. Terry Scuoler, the chief executive of the EEF, said: \"The EU is our sector\'s single biggest trading partner in a complex, tightly interwoven trading environment.\" He told the BBC that falling back on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules would hit some sectors hard.\"I struggle at the idea of dismantling what is the best free trade agreement in the world. WTO rules may well be an end-of-the-day back-up, but WTO rules... vary enormously across industrial sectors - 10\% on automotive and automotive parts and more for agricultural products.\" The prime minister is due to start the process of leaving the EU on Wednesday. Mrs May will trigger Article 50, after which the UK has two years to finalise the terms on which it will withdraw from the EU.\'Keep prices low\' The NFU, BRC and FDF urged ministers to ensure higher tariffs were not imposed on imported and exported produce. Although much of the industry is based in the UK, it \"cannot operate in isolation\", they said. Helen Dickinson, director general at the BRC, said the bloc was by far the UK\'s biggest trading partner for food.\"To keep prices low for consumers, it is particularly important that we don\'t have any new tariffs and we maintain frictionless movement of goods and put consumers at the heart of this,\" she told the . The groups\' members include British farms, food giants such as Nestle and supermarket chains such as Tesco. The prime minister has said leaving the EU with no deal would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. However, the food groups suggested the industry and consumers would suffer from the consequences of no trade deal if tariffs and customs checks were imposed after Brexit. They have called on the government to: Ensure a \"smooth and orderly Brexit\" by agreeing transitional arrangements. This would avoid \"costly and disruptive customs checks, processes and procedures\" Sign a free trade deal with the EU in the medium term.

'Ed Sheeran is final Glastonbury headliner Ed Sheeran is to headline the Pyramid Stage at this year\'s Glastonbury Festival, topping the bill alongside Radiohead and Foo Fighters.

He returned for a slot on the Pyramid Stage in 2014, memorably leading the audience in a mass sing-along to his smash hit Sing. He returns to Worthy Farm as one of the world\'s biggest pop stars, having sold four million copies of his third album, Divide, in the last 10 days. The star also dominates the singles chart, with all 16 of the tracks on his album residing in the Top 20. Radiohead are the Friday night headliners, making their first UK festival appearance since 2011. Foo Fighters take the Saturday night slot, making up for 2015 when they were forced to cancel. A handful of other acts have confirmed themselves for the festival - including Laura Marling and London Grammar. Lady Gaga is also rumoured to be playing, after being spotted backstage last year.

'Government defeated on Brexit bill The government has been defeated after the House of Lords said ministers should guarantee EU nationals\' right to stay in the UK after Brexit. The vote, by 358 to 256, is the first Parliamentary defeat for the government\'s Brexit bill. However, MPs will be able to remove their changes when the bill returns to the House of Commons. Ministers say the issue is a priority but must be part of a deal protecting UK expats overseas. The bill will give Theresa May the authority to trigger Brexit under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and begin official negotiations. The amendment backed by the Lords requires the government to introduce proposals within three months of Article 50 to ensure EU citizens in the UK have the same residence rights after Brexit. But it could be overturned when MPs, who have already backed the Brexit bill without amendments, vote on it again. The government is expected to attempt to overturn the defeat when the legislation returns to the Commons. The Department for Exiting the EU said: \"We are disappointed the Lords have chosen to amend a bill that the Commons passed without amendment. \"The bill has a straightforward purpose - to enact the referendum result and allow the government to get on with the negotiations.\"The government said its position had \"repeatedly been made clear\", saying it wanted to guarantee the rights of EU citizens and British nationals \"as early as we can\". Now what? Government sources tonight sound relaxed. They knew this vote was likely to go against them. And it\'s an issue that the government believes it has a clear defence on. Indeed, even during Theresa May\'s leadership campaign before she moved into Number 10, she articulated the same position. In her view, it would be unwise to guarantee the rights of the three million or so EU citizens in this country, before other EU countries are ready to do the same for British citizens abroad. For her opponents that\'s distasteful, immoral even, because many people who have made their lives in the UK could be used, so the phrase goes, as \"bargaining chips\" in a negotiation. There is little sign however of the government giving way despite the defeat. Ahead of the vote, the government made a last-minute attempt to persuade peers not to change the draft legislation. Brexit Minister Lord Bridges said the government had been keen to reach an agreement with other EU nations on the issue. However, he said, \"a small number of our European counterparts\" insisted there could be no discussions until the formal Brexit talks begin once Article 50 had been invoked. But most peers wanted a unilateral move from the UK government. Labour\'s shadow Brexit minister Lady Hayter said the concerns of EU nationals here and British expats living in Europe shouldn\'t be \"traded against each other\". She added: \"These people need to know now - not in two years\' time or even 12 months\' time. They simply can\'t put their lives on hold.\"Seven Conservative peers voted in favour of the amendment, which was proposed by Labour with the support of the Liberal Democrats. Among those opposing it during the sometimes heated exchanges was former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Tebbit, who said the debate seemed to focus on \"nothing but the rights of foreigners\". Shortly after the Lords vote, MEPs in the European Parliament debated the status of EU migrants in the UK. Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova told MEPs that EU citizens in UK and British citizens elsewhere in the EU \"deserve to know that their rights will be\" after Brexit. She said the matter should be addressed \"as soon as possible\" but that negotiations could only begin after the UK has triggered Article 50. The stages the Brexit bill needs to go through to become law: (It is currently at committee stage in the House of Lords) ',politics
'Google DeepMind\'s NHS deal under scrutiny A deal between Google\'s artificial intelligence firm DeepMind and the UK\'s NHS had serious \"inadequacies\", an academic paper has suggested. to build an app to alert doctors about patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). The authors said that it was \"inexcusable\" patients were not told how their data would be used. Google\'s DeepMind said that the report contained \"major errors\". It told the BBC that it was commissioning its own analysis and rebuttal, which the authors said they welcomed. When the deal between London\'s Royal Free Hospital and DeepMind became public in February 2016, some three months after the data started to be collected, it caused controversy over the amount of patient information being shared and the lack of public consultation. Hal Hodson, a former New Scientist journalist, and co-author Julia Powles, a Cambridge University academic, said there are still big questions to be answered about the tie-up.\"Why DeepMind, an artificial intelligence company wholly owned by data mining and advertising giant Google, was a good choice to build an app that functions primarily as a data-integrating user interface, has never been adequately explained by either DeepMind or Royal Free,\" they wrote. The app contains no artificial intelligence although DeepMind has said that it was hoping to incorporate AI techniques to create smarter alerts in future. The criticisms in the included: Questions over whether DeepMind could be considered a mere data processor when it developed an app - Streams - that had direct impact on patient care An absence of oversight or legally binding documents about how the data would be used Questions about whether the device was correctly registered with regulators In response, DeepMind and the Royal Free issued a joint statement: \"This paper completely misrepresents the reality of how the NHS uses technology to process data. \"It makes a series of significant factual and analytical errors, assuming that this kind of data agreement is unprecedented. \"In fact, every trust in the country uses IT systems to help clinicians access current and historic information about patients, under the same legal and regulatory regime.\"The authors invited both to respond in an \"open forum\", adding: \"The obvious fact is that we care about Google and DeepMind getting into healthcare because it is a break from the norm. \"These companies are entirely different to specialised health IT and infrastructure providers, and the sweeping analogy does a disservice to the public.\"Investigation The NHS does have information-sharing agreements with a range of third-party firms, but this is the first such deal with a major US tech firm. DeepMind\'s initial assertion that the NHS had 1, 500 other agreements with third-party organisations that process patient data has since been described by the NHS as \"inaccurate\". There is no central database on how many there are, the BBC was told. The app is currently the subject of an investigation by the Information Commissioner\'s Office while the National Data Guardian, tasked with safeguarding health data, is also looking at it. In a statement, the ICO told the BBC: \"Our investigation into the sharing of patient information between the Royal Free NHS Trust and Deep Mind is close to conclusion. \"We continue to work with the National Data Guardian and have been in regular contact with the Royal Free and Deep Mind who have provided information about the development of the Streams app. \"This has been subject to detailed review as part of our investigation. It\'s the responsibility of businesses and organisations to comply with data protection law.\"The National Data Guardian added: \"Our consideration of this matter has required a thorough approach in which the NDG and her panel have kept patients\' rightful expectations of both good care and confidentiality at the forefront of discussions. \"The NDG has provided a view on this matter to assist the ICO\'s investigation and looks forward to this being concluded as soon as practicable.\"Improved care DeepMind has been at pains to make clear that none of the data collected for the app has been shared with parent company Google. AKI is a serious condition, linked to 40, 000 deaths a year in the UK and leading to a range of other health issues from minor kidney dysfunction to the need for dialysis and transplant. In February, DeepMind published details about how the app was improving patient care. It revealed that more than 26 doctors and nurses at the Royal Free are now using Streams and that each day it alerts them to 11 patients at risk of AKI. Sarah Stanley, a consultant nurse who leads the patients at risk and resuscitation team, said: \"Streams is saving us a substantial amount of time every day. The instant alerts about some of our most vulnerable patients mean we can get the right care to the right patients much more quickly.\"DeepMind has acknowledged that it could have done better in the way it engaged with patients whose data was being used and, on the back of the criticism, agreed to set up patient forums. It published a strategy on future patient engagement which opens by saying: \"Outcomes are better when patients and clinicians make decisions together.\"',tech
'Jamie O\'Hara: Former Tottenham midfielder to join Billericay Town Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O\'Hara has signed for seventh-tier side Billericay Town.

'UK inflation rate leaps to 2. 3\% Rising fuel and food prices helped to push last month\'s inflation rate to the highest since September 2013. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) jumped to 2. 3\% in February - up from 1. 8\% in January. The increase has pushed the rate above the Bank of England\'s 2\% target. Food prices recorded their first annual increase for more than two-and-a-half years, standing 0. 3\% higher in February than a year earlier. The Bank of England has said it expects inflation will peak at 2. 8\% next year, although some economists think the rate could rise above 3\%. \"DON\'T PANIC\" are the words that will be written across the Bank of England\'s next inflation report, in large friendly letters. Well, maybe not, but the Bank\'s governor, Mark Carney, said pretty much the same when he was quizzed over today\'s jump in inflation. Actually, what he said was, \"Look - single data point, you never overreact to a single data point,\" but then he is a central banker and not the author of the Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy. It does, however, amount to much the same thing. The Bank of England is not going to be panicked into increasing interest rates to try to control price rises just because of one month\'s figures. But that doesn\'t mean they aren\'t important. They show fuel and food prices are rising, a situation not helped by the fall in the value of the pound, which makes imports more expensive. Prices at the factory gate are also rising quickly, suggesting more inflation is on the way to the High Street. And at 2. 3\%, inflation is increasing at the same rate as average earnings, meaning the average pay rise is being totally eaten up by increasing prices, not likely to make any of us feel better off. The Brexit vote last June prompted a steep fall in the value of the pound, making imported goods more expensive. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the fall in the pound against the dollar had been pushing transport costs higher since last summer.\"Oil is priced in dollars, and sterling has fallen around 13\%... since last June\'s referendum.\" He said that transport costs accounted for more than a third of the inflation figure. Consumer squeeze? This month, the ONS has started to promote its preferred , which includes a measure of housing costs and council tax. This was also measured as growing at a rate of 2. 3\% in February. The Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation rose to 3. 2\% in February from 2. 6\% the month before. At the last week\'s meeting of the Bank of England\'s interest rate setting committee, one member voted for interest rates to rise to curb the threat of inflation. But despite inflation standing above the 2\% target, some economists do not expect interest rates to rise any time soon. Inflation is now running at the same rate as growth in wages, putting pressure on household income and spending. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit, said: \"It remains likely that policymakers will adopt an increasingly dovish tone in coming months, despite the rise in inflation, as the economy slows due to consumers being squeezed by low pay and rising prices.\"The latest inflation figures show that the squeeze on savers just got a little tighter. Returns are creeping up - but only one of 793 openly available savings accounts matches or beats inflation, according to financial information service Moneyfacts. That one requires savings to be locked in for some time. The government\'s help for savers is a \"market-leading\" bond, available from NS&amp; I from April. Even that three-year deal is now outstripped by inflation and the picture could worsen if the inflation rate keeps rising. Wages had grown faster than prices for a while. For those who put some of that money aside, the reward may now not match the endeavour. ',business

'Scottish government to fund three IVF cycles on NHS Patients referred to the NHS for fertility treatment in Scotland could be eligible for three full cycles of IVF treatment from next month. The Scottish government said it would increase the number of IVF cycles available on the NHS for women under 40, from two to three. Older women aged between 40 and 42 will be offered one round of IVF if they fit certain criteria. It is expected to cost the NHS about £1m a year. Public health minister Aileen Campbell said the changes made access to NHS IVF in Scotland the \"fairest and most generous in the UK\". Speaking on the she defended the spending at a time of pressure on accident and emergency departments and waiting times. Ms Campbell said: \"We have always had a commitment towards ensuring there is as equitable access to IVF as there possibly can be and we had a number of recommendations presented to us that we accepted from the national infertility group.\"One of these included ensuring that couples could get access to three cycles of IVF. That is today what we are taking forward.\" It is thought that around one in seven couples experience difficulty having children. The announcement follows . Ms Campbell said: \"The very positive announcement of allowing couples who are desiring to have a family to get access to three cycles has been welcomed across the different fertility organisations.\"The SNP minister said money had been \"put aside\" to fund the IVF programme. Asked how she squared this with other demands on funding in the Scottish NHS, she said: \"We have got a fairly strong record across Scotland on our NHS. Some of our A&amp; Es have outperformed the lion\'s share of England\'s A&amp; Es.\"We are outperforming A&amp; Es across the UK and have done for some months.

She said: \"The reason for offering three cycles of treatment is because that\'s the most cost and clinically-effective number of treatments to offer patients. \"They [the Scottish government] have been very supportive over the last few years working with us on this.

'Tagged animals at risk from hunters and nature-lovers At-risk species, including wolves and sharks, are being targeted by hunters using signals sent by radio tags to home in on the animals. The behaviour of non-endangered species is also being skewed as nature fans use the signals to get close to wild animals, say biologists. A group of scientists has now begun collecting evidence to measure how tagged species are being harmed. They are calling for changes to tagging systems to make them harder to abuse. Hunting and fishing Prof Steven Cooke, a biologist at Carleton University in Canada, said growing numbers of scientists who use tagging were getting increasingly worried about the \"unintended consequences\" of the technology. \"We go out and do the science and provide the information and assume all is good but there are many ways in which this process can be corrupted,\" Prof Cooke told the BBC. Tagging with transponders that communicate via satellite or radio was becoming an increasingly common way to study species, he said, and had produced \"incredible\" insights into the movements and lifestyles of many different creatures. In some cases, he said, tags were used to keep an eye on small populations of endangered animals but there were also many cases in which tagging was used on a much more ambitious scale. For instance, he said, more than 100, 000 tagged fish were released in to the Columbia River basin every year to help monitor fish stocks, movements and migration patterns. The Great Lakes were also home to more than 5, 000 tagged fish, he added. Many different groups of people were interested in using the signals sent out by tags to locate all kinds of animals, said Prof Cooke. A paper co-written by Prof Cooke and other journal detailed some of the \"troubling\" ways in which tags had become an inadvertent aid to poachers, hunters, photographers and nature lovers. \"This is not something that a lot of papers have been written on,\" he said. \"We found a lot of the examples by searching on the net and on news sites and less traditional sources.\"Examples gathered by the scientists included: sharks tagged during a conservation programme in western Australia were found and then killed by people homing in on radio signals attempts by poachers in India to hack GPS data sent by collars on Bengal tigers commercial fishing vessels using radio data to find fish known to feed near the species they want to catch efforts by \"wolf-persecution\" groups in the US to decode signals to help them hunt down the predators Some national parks had taken steps to limit abuse by banning the radio receivers that can pick up the \"beeps\" sent out by some types of tag, said Prof Cooke. As a result of the paper, other biologists shared information about other ways tagged animals were being targeted, he said. Prof Brendan Godley, director of the centre for ecology and conservation at the University of Exeter, said the lifestyles of some species made it easier to abuse tag data. Knowing the approximate location of a shark, he said, would help track it down as they were likely to respond to lures, such as baited lines or food trails, put in the water close to them. By contrast, he said, other species may be far harder to find, despite being tagged, because they did not respond in the same way. Prof Godley added that tagging had an impact far beyond improving our understanding of how animals live. Tagging can directly contribute to conservation efforts and make them much more effective, he said.\"Within two weeks of tagging leatherback sea turtles we were able to show that the marine park that was set up for their benefit was inadequate,\" he said. Data provided by tagging showed which locations fishing fleets were told to avoid when turtles were nearby. However, he added, it was clear that tagging had become a contentious issue that had to be tackled.\"Scientists need to do a better job of getting the public aware of why they are doing the research and we need to do a better job of sharing the dividends of our work,\" he said.',tech
'Craig Shakespeare: Leicester City caretaker boss to be offered manager\'s job Craig Shakespeare will be offered the Leicester City manager\'s job until the end of the season, BBC Radio Leicester understands. Shakespeare was Claudio Ranieri\'s assistant, and has been caretaker boss since the Italian was The Foxes have since won both of their games with Shakespeare in charge. The 53-year-old has never managed full-time, and was brought to Leicester by Ranieri\'s predecessor, Nigel Pearson. Ranieri, 65, was sacked by Leicester nine months after leading the club to the Premier League title. Leicester have also spoken to other potential candidates to replace him, including Shakespeare\'s first match as caretaker manager was a over Liverpool. Speaking after that game, defender Danny Simpson said Shakespeare had \"kept it simple and told us what he wanted to do, which was simple and basic. We\'ve done that so let\'s hope we can carry it on for him\". After his side moved five points clear of the relegation zone with a over Hull on Saturday, Shakespeare said: \"My remit was to win these two games and that\'s what we\'ve done.\"Leicester next play Sevilla at home in the second leg of their last-16 Champions League tie next Tuesday. The Spanish side won the first leg 2-1. Analysis It\'s an appointment that will go down well on the terraces, the dressing room and in the media suite - Craig Shakespeare deserves this chance and is a top man to boot. Shakey, as he\'s affectionately known, fostered a close working relationship with Nigel Pearson in his first spell with the club as the Foxes cruised through League One and into the Championship. He followed Pearson to Hull after leaving the Foxes in 2010, only to return in 2011 following the dismissal of Sven-Goran Eriksson. Shakespeare opted to stay with Claudio Ranieri when he was appointed in the summer of 2015, a decision which sees a Premier League winners\' medal hanging on his mantelpiece. He\'s always expressed a wish to one day be his own man and while this may have come in a rather unorthodox way - and there is no suggestion it was anything other than picking up the pieces following the Italian\'s sacking - Shakespeare will relish this chance and, despite what Martin Keown may have said on Match of the Day at the weekend, has the support of the fans in the city.

'Philip Hammond: National Insurance U-turn to \'keep public\'s trust\' Chancellor Philip Hammond has defended making a U-turn on increasing National Insurance contributions for some self-employed workers., he said the government sets \"great store in the faith and trust\" of Britons and hoped the reversal showed \"we are listening\". Mr Hammond said it was important he and the prime minister met the \"spirit\" of the Tories\' 2015 manifesto pledge. Labour called the climb-down \"shocking and humiliating\". The chancellor had faced a backlash by Conservative backbenchers, who accused him of breaking a general election manifesto commitment not to put up National Insurance, income tax or VAT. In his letter to readers of The Sun, Mr Hammond wrote: \"Trust matters in politics. And this Conservative government sets great store in the faith and trust of the British people.\"He said people had questioned whether the planned increase in National Insurance for the self-employed was consistent with the tax pledges in the manifesto.\"After the 2015 general election, we acted to put these manifesto pledges into law and explained at that time that, when it came to National Insurance, this would apply to the main rate of National Insurance,\" he continued.\"But for the prime minister and me, it\'s not enough simply to stay within the letter of our tax lock law. It\'s important that we meet the spirit of our commitment as well.\"By making these changes, I hope we have shown that we are listening to people and demonstrating our determination to keep to both the letter and the spirit of our commitments.\"The Sun was one of the most outspoken newspapers against the increase when it was announced, because of the effect it would have on its \"White Van Man\" readers. Mr Hammond\'s Budget announcement would have increased Class 4 NICs from 9\% to 10\% in April 2018, and to 11\% in 2019, to bring it closer to the 12\% currently paid by employees. In a Commons statement, the chancellor told MPs: \"There will be no increases in National Insurance rates in this Parliament.\"Mr Hammond said he would use the Autumn Budget to set out further measures to \"fund in full\" the £2bn lost from NICs. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell described the climb-down as \"chaos\".\"It\'s shocking and humiliating that you have been forced to come here to reverse a key budget decision announced less than a week ago,\" he said. Asked by former SNP leader Alex Salmond \"who\" had realised the Budget was in \"flagrant breach\" of a manifesto commitment, Mr Hammond replied: \"I think it was Laura Kuenssberg on the BBC shortly after I said it in the Budget speech.\"Mr Corbyn said the government should \"apologise\" for the stress the announcement had caused Britain\'s 4. 8 million self-employed people. The SNP\'s Westminster leader Angus Robertson accused ministers of a \"screeching, embarrassing U-turn\". Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, an advocate of Britain remaining in the EU, questioned whether the chancellor would \"now U-turn on another broken election commitment to keep us in the single market\". Chris Bryce, CEO of the self-employed body IPSE, welcomed the U-turn, saying \"hard working people will sleep easier tonight\". Stephen Herring, the Institute of Directors\' head of taxation, said the National Insurance \"saga can only be described as chaotic\".',politics
'Google and Symantec clash on website security checks Search giant Google and security firm Symantec have clashed over the way websites are kept secure. a poor job of using standard tools, called certificates, that check the identity of thousands of websites. It will change its Chrome browser to stop recognising some Symantec certificates, causing problems for people who visit sites using them. Symantec said Google\'s claims were \"exaggerated\" and \"irresponsible\". The row concerns identity checks known as \"security certificates\", which underlie the HTTPS system that ensures data is encrypted as it travels to and from a website. Symantec is one of the biggest issuers of basic security certificates as well as their extended versions, which are supposed to give users more confidence in the security of a site.\'Strong objection\' Google alleges that Symantec has not done enough to ensure that these basic and extended certificates are being issued correctly. It claims to have evidence that over the past few years 30, 000 certificates are suspect. In a bid to tackle the problem, Google said it would change the way many versions of Chrome display information derived from Symantec certificates. This could mean many users get warnings that sites are insecure or are blocked from visiting them. In response, Symantec said it \"strongly objected\" to the way Google had acted, saying its decision was \"unexpected\". Its statement added that Google\'s statements about the way it issues certificates was \"exaggerated and misleading\". It threw doubt on the claim that 30, 000 certificates had been issued incorrectly and said only 127 had been identified as wrongly issued. Symantec said it had taken \"extensive remediation measures\" to improve the way it issued certificates and noted that many other certificate issuers had not gone as far. It queried why it had been \"singled out\" by Google when other certificate issuers were also at fault.\"We are open to discussing the matter with Google in an effort to resolve the situation in the shared interests of our joint customers and partners,\" it concluded.',tech
'Premiership: Northampton Saints 31-36 Leicester Tigers Leicester took a big stride towards the Premiership play-offs with a breathless East Midlands derby victory over top-four rivals Northampton in Aaron Mauger\'s last match in charge. Nafi Tuitavake\'s early score for Saints set the tone for a thrilling game. Adam Thompstone replied, but France\'s Louis Picamoles scored one try and made another to earn Saints a 22-16 lead. A breakaway Ben Youngs try and Lachlan McCaffrey\'s score edged Tigers ahead and Owen Williams\' boot sealed victory. Replacement Williams slotted a tricky conversion and two tough penalties to earn a win which takes Tigers up to fourth, three points ahead of Bath and six clear of their fierce rivals Saints, who drop to seventh. Both sides welcomed back their Six Nations stars and their quality shone through on a glorious day at Franklin\'s Gardens which served as a fitting farewell to Mauger, who was this week The glaring sun - and a swirling wind - played a huge part in the game\'s opening score, with Tuitavake touching down under the posts after Tigers full-back Telusa Veainu make a terrible mess of Stephen Myler\'s towering kick. Thompstone\'s swift response from a cute Ben Youngs pass as Tigers played through the phases levelled matters, but then Picamoles took centre stage. The huge Frenchman showed great awareness and good speed on the right to combine with Ahsee Tuala, who went over, and Picamoles then added a third home try following a Freddie Burns penalty. The boot of Burns helped keep Tigers in touch at the interval and the visitors led for the first time when impressive England scrum-half Ben Youngs scampered away on the left to score from distance. Despite their dominance in the scrum, Leicester struggled to deal with the strength and quick running of the Saints backline - notably from Wales wing George North. But Ben Youngs\' burst and McCaffrey\'s twist and score after another incisive break put the visitors in front and Welshman Williams showed typical nerve to kick Tigers to victory late on despite the sin-binning of Mike Williams.\"It\'s obviously an emotional day for Mauge and I thought he handled it really well.\"We came together as a side on Monday and talked about it. He said the board had made the decision and it was going to go a different way.\"He didn\'t want the decision to affect the performance in the week and he did a great job in setting the team up to come to Franklin\'s Gardens.\"It\'s tough to come here and get a win because I don\'t remember when the East Midlands derby hasn\'t been a one-score game. They are generally pretty tight games and the boys wanted to give Mauge a good send-off today. I think they did that.\"\"It could have gone either way. We made a very promising start, there were a few key moments in that game where, as we watch it back, we\'ll think \'what if?\'.\"Particularly at the end of the first half, we had a very good overlap and should have scored that.\"There were a few other interesting incidents, but it was a close game, either side could have won it and unfortunately we didn\'t win it today.\" Veainu; Thompstone, Tait, Mermoz, Pietersen; Burns, B Youngs; Genge, T Youngs (capt), Cole, Barrow, Kitchener, Fitzgerald, O\'Connor, Hamilton.

'How an obscure seed is helping to save the elephant Onno Heerma van Voss jokes that he never intended to be a conservationist, but he is helping to save the African elephant. Numbers of elephants in the wild are still falling; it\'s estimated 100 of them are killed by poachers every day for their tusks to meet the continuing demand for ivory. There are now only around 415, 000 African elephants across the continent, down from as many as five million a century ago, according to global campaign group WWF (formerly known as the World Wide Fund for Nature). While the worldwide sale of new ivory was outlawed in 1989, the animals are still being slaughtered to fuel an illegal trade led by continuing demand in China. So what exactly is Mr Heerma van Voss, a 48-year-old Dutchman, doing to help protect the African elephant? He sells seeds. Yes, you read that correctly, but these aren\'t any old seeds, they are instead rather special ones from South America called tagua. They are the off-white coloured seeds of six species of palm trees. They can reach up to 9cm (3. 5 inches) in length and when dried become very hard indeed. So hard in fact that they are also known as \"vegetable ivory\". And like ivory, tagua can be polished and carved, and turned into ornate carvings or jewellery. From his base in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, Mr Heerma van Voss\'s company Naya Nayon has been exporting tagua for 16 years, and he says that sales are booming. He now sells to 70 countries, including China, Japan and Singapore, as tagua grows in popularity as an alternative to ivory. And with China pledging to end its domestic trade in elephant tusks by the end of this year, Mr van Voss is hopeful that demand is going to jump even further. Elephant plant Using tagua as a substitute for ivory is nothing new. Indeed exports to Europe began in the 19th Century in order to meet the demand for an ivory-like raw material. This was used to produce ornamental items such as buttons, chess pieces, and decorative handles for canes. In fact, the scientific name for the six species of palm trees that produce tagua is Phytelephas, which means elephant plant, a nod to the ivory-like quality of the seeds. However, tagua fell into obscurity, so much so that Mr Heerma van Voss had never heard of it when he first visited Ecuador in 2000. Very much liking the country he decided to stay and set up a business, launching Naya Nayon to make and export wooden furniture. Then a year later he had a phone call.\"In the beginning of 2001, a France-based British lady contacted me if I could supply hand carved tagua figurines,\" he says. \"Anyhow, you listen to clients to make a company work. So I did it, and I started to like the tagua and slowly it took off. \"I always joke that I am a forced ecologist, but I actually really like this product.\" Mr Heerma van Voss now sells $200, 000 (£160, 000) worth of tagua per year that he buys from farmers. He and his four members of staff dry and slice the seeds ready to be turned into jewellery, with France being his largest market. The sliced tagua typically retails for $30 a kg, while the raw seeds sell for $6 a kg. By contrast, a kilogramme of ivory is worth as much as $1, 100 in China. While Mr Heerma van Voss is preparing for a big upturn in exports to China, tagua does face two hurdles in the country. Firstly, even the longest tagua seeds are much shorter than the average elephant tusk, which limits the size of the ornaments that can be made from the material. And secondly, it lacks ivory\'s exclusivity. Hongxiang Huang, a Chinese journalist and anti-ivory campaigner, explains: \"As people become wealthier they want to buy luxury items, and ivory is one of the many things that people desire. This is the situation in China.\"Hairy tale For buyers wanting an alternative to elephant ivory that still comes from a mammal but is ethically sourced, the answer comes from under the frozen Siberian tundra in the north east of Russia. It may sound bizarre, but the tusks from woolly mammoths that died tens of thousands of years ago are mined on a regular basis. While official figures are not available, an estimated 60 tonnes of mammoth ivory is harvested each year. Mammoth ivory sold for an average $350 a kg in 2014, according to the charity Save the Elephants. This is about a third of the price of elephant ivory, but giant mammoth tusks in good condition can fetch far more. John Frederick Walker, an expert on ivory, says: \"Master carvers tend to prefer elephant ivory because fresh elephant ivory is easier to carve.\"But in fact, you can make wonderful things from mammoth ivory.\"Yet with tagua far easier to get hold of than mammoth ivory, and considerably cheaper, it is the South American seeds that is increasingly being used by jewellers, and not the Siberian tusks. Marion Andron is co-owner of French jewellers Nodova, which sold more than 300, 000 euros ($320, 000; £256, 000) of tagua jewellery last year. Ms Andron, 27, travels to Ecuador twice a year to oversee the production of the tagua that is done by seven local women at a cooperative. While Nodova\'s largest markets are France and the UK, it sells to stores across Asia and Ms Andron says that the forthcoming blanket ban on ivory sales in China offers a huge opportunity.\"I think tagua has helped diminish the demand for animal ivory, and I honestly don\'t think someone today can be ignorant about the slaughter of elephants with all the media coverage,\" she says.',business
'The sequels that should never have been made Gladiator is the latest film which might be receiving the sequel treatment. The film, which was directed by Ridley Scott, won the best picture Oscar in 2000. Before now, many of us thought a sequel was out of the question because Maximus Decimus Meridius, played by the film\'s star, Russell Crowe, you know, died at the end of the last one. But by the sound of it, Scott\'s not going to let such minor details stand in his way.\"I know how to bring him back,\" he said at South by South West (SXSW) recently. \"Whether it will happen I don\'t know. Gladiator was 2000, so Russell\'s changed a little bit. He\'s doing something right now but I\'m trying to get him back down here.\"Sequels often make a lot of money at the box office - but aren\'t always a good idea creatively. Here are just a few of the real turkeys: Few bigger sequel disasters spring to mind than Sex and the City 2. The franchise was hugely popular as a TV show, and fans responded well to the first big-screen adaptation. But SATC2\'s release in 2010 saw even some of the most diehard fans turn against it. The film still made money, but fans mostly hated it and the critics were even less enthusiastic.\"An enervated, crass and gruesomely caricatured trip to nowhere [that] seems conceived primarily to find new and more cynical ways to abuse the loyalty of its audience,\" said . Speed was, apart from being a terrific film, something of a surprise hit. The critics loved it. Audiences loved it. A sequel was duly scheduled. But 1997\'s Speed 2: Cruise Control fell at the first hurdle. Although Sandra Bullock (pictured) came back for a second bite of the cherry, the film\'s other star, Keanu Reeves, didn\'t sign up. Jason Patric took the reins instead and the sequel was given a much bigger budget than its predecessor. But instead of the speeding buses and underground trains of the first, Speed 2 took place on... a slow-moving boat. The slightly less exhilarating setting might have contributed to its eight Golden Raspberry nominations (it won in the worst remake or sequel category). Jaws 2\'s \"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water\" was one of the most memorable straplines in movie history. Unfortunately, it also wasn\'t safe for fans of the first film to go back in the cinema. While the original holds a 97\% rating on reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the follow-up has a much lower 52\%. Its strapline turned out to be the most memorable thing about it - and has far outlived the film itself. To be fair though, Jaws 2 performed well at the box office and wasn\'t as bad as what followed. 1983\'s Jaws 3-D and Jaws: The Revenge, which followed in 1987, were the franchise\'s real disasterpieces. In 1999, The Blair Witch Project went viral long before going viral was even a thing. The horror film used the internet to build a back story for the movie, posting fake police reports and fictional news articles about the Blair Witch, leaving many confused about whether the film was real or fictional. The campaign succeeded in building huge levels of hype around the movie, which was a box office phenomenon. You can guess what\'s coming next. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 abandoned the shaky first-person camera work in favour of becoming a more conventional horror film. It made a profit, but took about $200m (£161m) less than its predecessor. Its threequel, 2016\'s Blair Witch, made even less money, but again it made a profit - which is more than a lot of films can say at the moment. You could certainly argue that this one falls more into the category. Which is to say that a film perhaps shouldn\'t count as a bad sequel if the original film was pretty bad in the first place. Sequels are the worst when you\'ve built up high expectations from the first film, which is something 2001\'s Zoolander could hardly claimed to have done. from Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Katy Perry couldn\'t quite salvage the hot mess that was last year\'s Zoolander 2. Interestingly, it was one of three sequels released in 2016 which left a huge gap between films. It came 15 years after Zoolander, while My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 and Bad Santa 2 had gaps of 13 and 14 years respectively. There are so many weakquels and threequels to choose from we couldn\'t possibly do them all justice here. Indeed, this feature about sequels may need a sequel. There\'s The Matrix Revolutions, Miss Congeniality 2, Legally Blonde 2, Blues Brothers 2000, Dumb and Dumber To and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Just for the pure brilliance of its title, a special mention also go to Alvin and The Chipmunks: The Squeakquel. If the next instalment of The Equalizer isn\'t called The Sequelizer (and, if there\'s a third, The Threequelizer) we\'re going to be bitterly disappointed.',entertainment
'Opposition MPs join forces to oppose grammar schools A powerful new cross-party campaign is threatening to derail Theresa May\'s plans to expand the number of grammar schools in England. Former Conservative Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is joining forces with Lib Dem ex-Deputy PM Nick Clegg and Labour ex-shadow education minister Lucy Powell to oppose the proposals. Mrs Morgan says the priority should be to make all schools good. But Mrs May says her \"personal mission\" is to increase diversity in schools. In a joint article in the Observer, Mrs Morgan, Mr Clegg and Ms Powell argue that creating new grammar schools will do nothing to promote social mobility - and warn there is no room for more \"division or political ideology\" in the education system. \"We must rise to the challenge with a new national mission to boost education and social mobility for all,\" they write.\"That\'s why we are putting aside what we disagree on, to come together and to build a cross-party consensus in favour of what works for our children, and not what sounds good to politicians.\"Mrs Morgan, who was education secretary from 2014 until she was sacked by Mrs May when she became prime minister in 2016, said her experience had shown that the focus needs to be on schools in areas of the country where educational under performance is entrenched.\"I don\'t think selection is the answer to that...\" she told ITV\'s Robert Peston.\"I know from running a department there\'s only so much brain space to deliver reform and actually, if you are going to start moving your focus to selection and having a political battle about that, then you lose the focus on making all schools good.\"Vulnerable? The trio\'s intervention is likely to set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street after other influential Conservatives, including the chairman of the Commons education committee Neil Carmichael, also voiced opposition to the plan. With a working majority of just 17, Mrs May\'s vulnerability to Tory revolts was underlined last week when Chancellor Philip Hammond was forced to back down over his Budget reforms to National Insurance contributions for self-employed workers following a backlash from the backbenches. In their article, the three say that while grammar schools \"can boost attainment for the already highly gifted, they do nothing for the majority of children who do not attend them.\"Indeed, in highly selective areas, children not in grammars do worse than their peers in non-selective areas.\"Former Conservative Education Secretary Michael Gove said while he was not against selection per se, he would need to look at each individual proposition as it is put forward. He told journalists at the Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai: \"I thought Nicky was a great education secretary and I think hers is a voice always worth listening to in the debate, but I take a slightly different position.\"I\'m going to wait to see what the government brings forward but I think that the thing to do for someone like me is to say there\'s no merit in looking at this, or I won\'t look at this I should say, through any prism other than looking at what\'s proposed, looking at the evidence and considering each proposal on its merits.\"But Labour\'s Stephen Kinnock warned against \"tinkering around\" with the education system, especially at a time when the country is divided over Brexit.\"What you need is an education system that lifts everybody - we know that making people take tests at the age of 11, which in many cases is far too early to see what their real potential is, is divisive,\" he told ITV\'s Peston on Sunday programme.',politics
'MWC 2017: LG G6 phone is made for split-screen apps LG has ditched the modular design of its previous flagship smartphone and unveiled a new top-end model that is designed for split-screen uses. To achieve this, the G6\'s display has an 18: 9 aspect ratio, rather than the 16: 9 used by most handsets. It means that when viewed in landscape mode, the screen appears wider than normal. LG has acknowledged that last year\'s G5 missed its sales targets. One analyst said the change in strategy was wise. The new device was unveiled in Barcelona ahead of the opening of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) trade show. LG\'s new phone was also distinguished by being the first Android device announced to include Google Assistant - the search giant\'s voice-controlled rival to Apple\'s Siri - beyond Google\'s own Pixel phone. Split-screen experiences The G6\'s display measures 5. 7in (14. 5cm) compared to the G5\'s 5. 3in (13. 5cm) component. It is also brighter, adding support for high dynamic range (HDR) video playback. This makes compatible footage appear more vibrant and detailed in the shadows. The new device can also be submerged underwater for up to half an hour. Yet the G6 is thinner and slightly smaller than last year\'s model thanks to the decision to abandon add-on components - such as a higher quality audio processor - and a return to an irremovable battery. The new phone is designed around Android 7\'s support for split-screen software, allowing two same-sized square interfaces to be seen either side-by-side or one-above-the-other, depending on how the phone is held. Suggested uses include: running two different apps alongside each other displaying a monthly calendar in one box, and a day\'s agenda in the other showing a music album\'s artwork and play controls in one interface, and a list of the songs it contains in the other A further use of the split screens would be to help take square-shaped photos for the social network Instagram. When the phone is held vertically, the top box shows the live view from the camera while the bottom one displays the last photo taken. The idea is to make it possible to review an image without the risk of missing another key moment. However, one side effect of the screen\'s unusual aspect ratio is that many apps will have to be slightly stretched to fit it, unless the owner opts not to use the full screen. Ticking boxes LG acknowledges that the G6 is less radical than last year\'s offering, but it hopes that means demand will be stronger than it was for the G5. \"I\'d love to be sat here now saying that the mass market had adopted it and understood it - unfortunately that wasn\'t the case,\" Jeremy Daniels, head of sales for LG UK told the BBC.\"We proved the concept could be done, but actually we know that [this year] we had to tick a lot of boxes like water resistance and bigger battery.\"And that could only be done by moving to a design that was more appealing to the masses.\"LG is the world\'s sixth bestselling smartphone maker, according to the research firm IDC. Figures indicate that the South Korean firm shipped 7\% fewer handsets in 2016 compared to the previous year.\'Fatally flawed\' Despite the G5\'s struggles, its unusual design won plaudits when it was unveiled a year ago. The GSM association - a trade body representing the world\'s mobile operators - even introduced at 2016\'s MWC. But one expert said the idea of adding functionality via add-on accessories - known as friends - proved to be unwieldy in practice. \"If you look at the way G5 worked - owners had to open the case, remove the battery and power down the device before putting in another friend - that concept was fatally flawed,\" said Tim Coulling from the tech consultancy Canalys.\"Also because the phone had to be taken apart a lot, there were problems with dust and water. \"So, the decision to move back from modular to non-modular is completely the correct decision.\"Over the past year, Google has also cancelled its Project Ara modular smartphone concept. But Lenovo continues to pursue the modular idea with its Moto Z devices, which do not need to be switched off when their parts are swapped.',tech
'Adam Peaty: Olympic champion passing on pressure and putting party time to bed There is no escaping 5am starts, lung-crushing 50m sprint sets, relentless double training sessions designed to push the body to the limit and the added bonus of punishing gym routines. At the age of 14, with a taste of what could be in store, future reigning Commonwealth, European, World and Olympic champion Adam Peaty was pretty sure the swimmer\'s life was not for him.\"I remember it was a Sunday evening and we used to do a double session on Sundays so it was a full training day,\" breaststroke specialist Peaty told BBC Sport from his new training base in Loughborough. \"I was in the gym doing 3, 000 reps of everything, burpees and press ups until I was goosed.\"I got into the car and said to my mum: \'I don\'t want to do this any more, I want to quit\'. She said just keep going until the end of the next week and so on each week.\" A mother\'s wisdom involving some cleverly-timed mind games kept the teenage Peaty sweet enough to see the hard work begin to pay off. But the 22-year-old is clear in his mind that his long-serving coach Mel Marshall - now the - takes considerable credit for his incredible transformation from a kid \"whose times weren\'t the best\" to the world\'s best. Marshall\'s appointment as head coach at the City of Derby Swimming Club in November 2008 was the start of an incredible journey for both of them.\"It was insane when I first started,\" explained Peaty. \"I was making up for time I had lost, I was racing kids who had been racing for ages, who had that experience and fitness on me.\"But as soon as I started to get the ball rolling with Mel, that was when it popped and everything kind of blew up.\"Peaty plays catch-up In swimming terms, only taking the sport completely seriously at the age of 14 meant he had some catching up to do. Many top-level swimmers have been sampling the delights of six or seven sessions per week and ungodly alarm calls since before they have reached double digits.\"I speak to a lot of kids and parents and they are throwing their kids into 4am training at eight, nine and 10 years old,\" said Peaty. \"It\'s weird because, for me, I think I have been successful because I haven\'t had that grilling from a young age.\"It is no wonder that swimming is seen as a very young person\'s sport and that it is commonplace for retirement to come in the mid-20s. Double Olympic champion at the age of 23, while one of the world\'s best sprinters Fran Halsall at the age of 26 in January. \"Some of the best athletes in the world are the late starters,\" said Uttoxeter-born Peaty. \"Maybe they have more energy because they haven\'t been doing it for so long.\"As soon as I left school, I wanted to do it professionally and here I am.\"I am enjoying it a lot more from 16 or 17, whereas kids who have done it from a young age - sometimes, not always - are burning out at 16 or 17 and want to do other things like hang out with their mates, go to the cinema and at 18 go to the pub.\"Party in the past The rare possibility of a few drinks at the pub was part of the post-Rio partying process. An entire month off was as needed as it was welcomed. And Peaty is feeling the benefit.\"We needed that emotional and physical break so we can repair everything,\" he explained. \"You can have a bit of downtime and enjoy having a little bit of a normal life. We don\'t drink and eat bad food when we are training. To go and party and celebrate the proper way was so needed.\"Another significant change has been Peaty\'s relocation, which has seen him move house from the Derby area to be within 10 minutes of his Loughborough training base. The improved facilities and cutting down on travelling has been a big help. \"My times are really good for this time of year. It\'s looking good to say the least,\" he said.\"My performance has gone up again, which is great to hear at the start of another four-year cycle. I personally think I have got stronger. I am lifting more in the gym and am swimming faster for longer.\" Marshall concurs.\"In the water he is certainly not holding back,\" said his coach of nine and a half years. \"I am seeing him do things recently that he has never done before. It\'s very exciting.\"I want to really harness things that are special. We have got a history and have been through a lot together so I want to keep those elements, but I also want us to grow as a relationship. Marshall says Peaty has embraced his celebrity and success but remains grounded and humble. But there are differences.\"He drives a really nice car now,\" she said. \"He has changed but for the better; he copes with the media really well, he gives back to the community, he gets involved in charity challenges, he\'s a good role model and always has time for everybody. \"In terms of those things you are looking for from an Olympic champion, he really exercises those on a regular basis.\" There seems little risk of complacency from either Marshall or Peaty.\"Mel is always the first one to ground you,\" said Peaty. \"Even if you think you will have a little bit of a walk, she says: \'Oi you, get in the pool and do this\'. That is the way I like it. That is the way to have to work if you want to be professional.\"I want to get into the pool every single day and not care about what I have done in the past. I want to look to the future and this is how I get a better future. That is the way I see it.\"Taking on the world and passing on the pressure The chance and desire to defend his many titles means Peaty has more than enough goals to focus on during the next four-year Olympic cycle.\"It\'s weird because it\'s starting again,\" he said. \"It\'s my second time around.\"I\'m getting older and I\'m becoming one of the more experienced ones in the group. I\'m not that kid who was trying to take on the world and be everything at the same time.\"Now I\'m wiser and a bit more experienced. I know where to put my energy and I know where to put my emotions - and hopefully it will come out with more wins.\" Peaty says pressure is something that \"pushes him\", rather than holding him back.\"I never ever feel pressure,\" he said. \"I think that was why I could go into my first Olympics, race and get a world record and I could go into an Olympic final and not really treat it as an Olympic final - except from the last 50 where I was possessed. \"You have to open your mind up to that positivity and fill your mind with the positive thoughts.\"And the positive thought this time is I am the Olympic champion, world champion, European champion and Commonwealth champion.\"I have the world record and that is probably what the competitors are thinking about, so it\'s their thing to worry about and mine to gain confidence from.\"',sport
'Snapchat firm share price soars on debut Shares in Snap, owner of messaging app Snapchat, rose 44\% in their first day of trading on the US stock market. At the close of trade on Thursday, shares were $24. 48 each, up from their opening offer price of $17 a share. It left Snap valued at almost $30bn, although it has never made a profit. The firm\'s initial public offering is the biggest for a US tech firm since Facebook in 2012 and will turn the company\'s founders, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, into multi-billionaires. Snapchat, which is especially popular with teenagers, allows users to send images and messages which then vanish. The company\'s losses widened last year, and user growth is slowing down in the face of intense competition from larger rivals such as Facebook. Despite the challenges in converting \"cool\" into cash, Snap\'s valuation is the richest for a US tech flotation since Facebook in 2012. At the beginning of February Snap\'s of its plans revealed that the company had revenue of $404m last year, but made a loss of $515m. Unlike in most listed companies, people who buy the floated shares in Snap will not get any voting rights. Some analysts argued the company was overvalued.\"Snap is a promising early stage company with significant opportunity ahead of itself.\"Unfortunately, it is significantly overvalued given the likely scale of its long-term opportunity and the risks associated with executing against that opportunity,\" wrote analyst Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research in a note. He gave it a \"sell\" rating. Others were more positive. Before the trading debut, Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at Ayondo Markets, said: \"What sets it apart from other messaging apps like WhatsApp for me is the innovative features built into the app\'s interface, such as the lenses function. \"A pertinent point in the company\'s S1 filing for the IPO is that it doesn\'t call itself a messaging service, but a camera company.\" \"This seems to be an intentional move to differentiate it from Facebook and Twitter and the success and failure of their respective IPOs, which in my view, is very clever.\"',business
'Oscars Envelopegate: This is why both PwC accountants have been banned Quite a few people are wondering why both of the accountants responsible for \"envelopegate\" at the Oscars have been let go by the Academy, when only one appeared to be responsible. Brian Cullinan handed Warren Beatty the wrong envelope on Sunday night, which led to the being announced as best picture. The Academy\'s not to employ Cullinan and his colleague Martha Ruiz again in the future has led to some wondering why she is also being punished. Now, one of the stage managers has explained. Gary Natoli told that Ruiz was equally responsible for halting proceedings when the wrong winner was announced, but she failed to step in.\"I was in the wings stage left with Jimmy [Kimmel] when they announced La La Land,\" he explained.\"We watched for about 10 more seconds, and during that entire time Martha was no more than five feet away from us. Plans for Oscars mistakes \"When La La Land was announced, she did not try to get my attention, she did not say anything. And she\'s supposed to have memorised the winners.\"Natoli added that, before the ceremony, he had specifically told the pair that they should get to the stage \"immediately\" if any wrong winners were announced. \"Brian had done an interview where he was asked about it, so he came up to John [Esposito, another stage manager] and me and told us that in the interview, he said, \'Well, we would tell the stage managers and check with each other and react.\' \"And then he said to us, \'Is that what we do?\'\"I said, \'If you know who the winner is, you don\'t need to check with each other. You need to immediately go out and rectify the situation, ideally before the wrong winners get to the mic.\' And he said, \'OK, good, that\'s what we thought.\'\"\'Have Martha check her envelope\' Natoli also gave his own account of what happened on the night from the moment La La Land had been incorrectly announced as best picture.\"I heard John Esposito on my headset say, \'Brian says he didn\'t think they said the right winner. Can you have Martha check her envelope?\' \"That was the first time I heard anything about it.\"He radioed another stage manager to find Ruiz and have her open the second best picture envelope. \"[Ruiz] was standing there with the envelope in her hand, very low-key, and John Esposito said that Brian was very low-key too, no urgency. But we had Martha open the envelope, and it said Moonlight.\"Natoli said he then instantly told the other stage managers to \"Get the accountants out there\", but he said both Cullinan and Ruiz hesitated.\"John was trying to get Brian to go on stage, and he wouldn\'t go,\" he said. \"And Martha wouldn\'t go. We had to push them on stage, which was just shocking to me.\"\"I still do not understand the delay,\" he added. \"Brian should have run out there on his own. Martha should have run out there. \"I didn\'t get on the headset and say, \'Hey, producers, this is what\'s happening. What do we do?\' We took our own initiative and got it done - and if we hadn\'t done that, we could have been off the air before it was fixed. I\'m proud of the way that we handled it, given the lack of response from PwC.\"Natoli also said the new design of the envelopes, with the category printed in a much smaller font than previous years, may have contributed to the error not being spotted sooner.\"I\'m sure they\'re very lovely people, but they just didn\'t have the disposition for this,\" Natoli said. \"You need somebody who\'s going to be confident and unafraid.\"',entertainment
'Boris Johnson to avoid diplomatic spy row during US visit Boris Johnson will avoid discussing claims the UK\'s intelligence agency spied on Donald Trump when he visits Washington later, officials say. Instead, the foreign secretary will focus on forging a UK-US free trade Brexit deal when he meets senior members of the president\'s team. Britain is said to be ready to forget the spat after the US agreed not to repeat claims GCHQ wiretapped Mr Trump. GCHQ said the claims made by the White House were \"nonsense\". Mr Johnson will meet with congressional leaders and members of Mr Trump\'s team in Washington, including chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior adviser Kellyanne Conway. \'Utterly ridiculous\' Officials said he will not raise the diplomatic row which was sparked when White House press secretary Sean Spicer repeated allegations GCHQ spied on Mr Trump for Barack Obama. The UK is said to be satisfied by reassurances from the US that the claims - described by GCHQ as being as \"utterly ridiculous\" - will not be repeated. Officials hope Mr Johnson can carve out a role as a link-man between No 10 and the White House, says the BBC\'s diplomatic correspondent James Landale. On his three-day visit to the US, the foreign secretary will attend a summit of countries fighting so-called Islamic State and chair a meeting of the UN security council. He will also host a UN event on female empowerment around the world, aimed at giving women better access to schools, jobs and democracy. ',politics
'Jawbone denies \'abandoning\' customers Owners of Jawbone fitness trackers are complaining on social media that the firm\'s customer support has vanished. At the time of writing, Jawbone\'s Twitter and Facebook support accounts had not been updated for several weeks. Some customers say their emails are not being answered either, and the UK helpline has a recorded message saying customer service is not currently available in the UK or EU. A spokesman told the BBC customer care is \"days from being back online\". He added that the firm was \"in a process of transition\". Lisa Cope shared an email she sent the firm in December 2016 saying she had been unable to use her Jawbone since the summer following various issues with the tracker not working properly and problems charging the device. She said she has not yet had a reply.\"I loved the Jawbone until it stopped working,\" she said.\"I thought it was a very good product and app, but had lots of flaws. I\'m disgusted that they think they can just stop customer service even though they\'re still operational.\" Rebecca Wire said her Jawbone Up2 was successfully replaced last year but the replacement is now being held together with gaffer tape and she has had no contact with the firm for over a month. Lisa Davidson said her new fitness tracker stopped syncing with her phone after five weeks and she has also been unable to contact Jawbone.\"I regret not buying a Fitbit now,\" she told us. The firm is currently scoring 0. 4 out of a possible 10 on , with 170 reviews. TechCrunch reported in February that Jawbone - once a popular fitness tracker brand - and focus on healthcare providers. However its wrist bands are still widely available. The Up3 is currently on sale for £53. 99 on Amazon in the UK.\"I think Jawbone is not sure how to move forward,\" said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies.\"The mainstream consumer market right now is a cut-throat business and the high-end is controlled by Apple so looking at the medical sector might seem an option - but I am just not sure they have skills that would set them apart.\"Jawbone might say they are coming back to wearables but it is hard to see how they could do that successfully.

'Neil Warnock unhappy with John and Noone after Blackburn draw Manager Neil Warnock hinted Declan John and Craig Noone\'s Cardiff City\'s futures are in doubt after holding them responsible for Blackburn\'s in their 1-1 draw.

That\'s what we\'re doing - learning about next season and who you want on board.\" Warnock also blamed himself for sending John and Noone on among only six substitutes, but said his bench choices were limited by injuries going into the game.\"Before the game you\'d have taken a point, wouldn\'t you,\" he said.\"It\'s my own fault - I put the subs on. Two of them cost us the goal.\"Overall Warnock has been pleased by Cardiff\'s progress since his arrival in October and offered praise to striker Zahore and full-backs Jazz Richards and Joe Bennett \"I think Kenneth Zahore can get better and he\'s got to try and last the games as well fitness wise,\" the manager said.\"I mean you can\'t fault him - 80 minutes the way I\'m asking him to move about and he\'s got such a big frame as well, but he\'s enjoying it.\"I love him.

'Is robotics a solution to the growing needs of the elderly? The receptionist at the Institute of Media Innovation, at Singapore\'s Nanyang Technological University, is a smiling brunette called Nadine. From a distance, nothing about her appearance seems unusual. It\'s only on closer inspection that doubts set in. Yes - she\'s a robot. Nadine is an \"intelligent\" robot capable of autonomous behaviour. For a machine, her looks and behaviour are remarkably natural. She can recognise people and human emotions, and make associations using her knowledge database - her \"thoughts\", so to speak. At IMI, they are still fine-tuning her receptionist skills. But soon, Nadine might be your grandma\'s nurse. Ageing populations Research into the use of robots as carers or nurses is growing. It\'s not hard to see why. The global population is ageing, putting strain on healthcare systems. Although many 80-year-olds may only need a friend to chat to, or someone to keep an eye out in case they fall, increasingly the elderly are suffering serious ailments, such as dementia. How can we provide quality care to address this array of needs? Many experts think an answer could be robots. Nadine is being developed by a team led by Prof Nadia Thalmann. They have been working on virtual human research for years; Nadine has existed for three.\"She has human-like capacity to recognise people, emotions, and at the same time to remember them,\" says Prof Thalmann. Nadine will automatically adapt to the person and situation she deals with, making her ideally suited to looking after the elderly, Prof Thalmann says. The robot can monitor a patient\'s wellbeing, call for help in an emergency, chat, read stories or play games. \"The humanoid is never tired or bored,\" says Prof Thalmann. \"It will just do what it is dedicated for.\"Nadine isn\'t perfect, though. She has trouble understanding accents, and her hand co-ordination isn\'t the best. But Prof Thalmann says robots could be caring for the elderly within 10 years. Not ready for robots US technology giant IBM is also busy with robo-nurse research, in partnership with Rice University, in Houston, Texas. They have created the IBM Multi-Purpose Eldercare Robot Assistant (Mera). Mera can monitor a patient\'s heart and breathing by analysing video of their face. It can also see if the patient has fallen, and pass information to carers. However, not everyone is ready for a robot carer, acknowledges Susann Keohane, IBM global research leader for the strategic initiative on aging. This view is backed by research by Gartner, which found \"resistance\" to the use of humanoid robots in elderly care. People were not comfortable with the idea of their parents being cared for by robots, despite evidence it offers value for money, says Kanae Maita, principal analyst in personal technologies innovation at Gartner Research. Internet of things Amid this scepticism, IBM believes its Internet of Things (IoT) research may prove more immediately valuable. The firm is studying how sensors and IoT can identify changes in physical conditions or anomalies in a person\'s environment. By recording atmospheric readings - such as carbon dioxide - in a patient\'s room, carers could understand a person\'s habits, such as when they eat lunch, or take a walk, without invading their private space. Carers could spot changes remotely and respond accordingly. Ms Keohane says: \"There\'s a real opportunity to create new innovative solutions, including the use of robotics and the Internet of Things, that will help people extend their independence, and enrich their quality of life.\"Robo-pets While widespread use of humanoids may be a long way off, robo-pets are already in use across the world. Developed in Japan, Paro is a therapeutic baby seal that has been shown to reduce the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. The seals respond to touch and are designed to make eye contact. About 5, 000 are in use. Clinical trials with dementia patients, conducted by Dr Sandra Petersen\'s team at the University of Texas at Tyler, found Paro improved symptoms such as depression, anxiety and stress. The need for symptom-related medication reduced by a third. In some cases the results were even more remarkable. Dr Petersen says: \"Some patients that were non-verbal began speaking again - first to the seal, then to others about the seal.\"There are drawbacks to robo-pets, Dr Petersen admits - notably the cost. A Paro costs about $5, 000 (£4, 000). There is also a reluctance by some in the medical profession to adopt non-pharmacological therapies. Nonetheless, Dr Petersen believes the Paro may have a role in many health-related settings, as the seal\'s artificial intelligence allows it be programmed to adapt to a variety of behaviours. \"I think the Paro may have a role in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, in neurocognitive rehabilitation with stroke patients, and with pain management or palliative care patients,\" she says.\"Autism-spectrum children may benefit from interaction with the seal.\"\'Ethical trade-off\' Inevitably, there are downsides to robotic solutions. One issue, says Prof Sethu Vijayakumar, director of Edinburgh University\'s Centre for Robotics, is whether the spread of humanoid carers could lead to the increasing isolation of the elderly. \"We have to ask: are [robots] isolating people more, or really helping people?\" Prof Vijayakumar says. The use of robotics also raises concerns about personal data issues, he says.\"The quality and personalisation of [robotic] services are directly proportionate to the amount of data you\'re willing to release to the system. Your data becomes a type of currency for access to better services.\"It\'s an interesting ethical trade-off. A very sensitive area.\"Doubts aside, Prof Vijayakumar says the growth of robo-care is inevitable. \"Demographics being the way it is, we will see significant use of robotics in dealing with the problems of old age.\"Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on and ',business

'London attack: Theresa May tells MPs \'we\'ll never waver\' Prime Minister Theresa May has told MPs: \"We will never waver in the face of terrorism.\"Paying tribute to Pc Keith Palmer, who died after being stabbed, she said: \"He was every inch a hero and his actions will never be forgotten.\"Delivering a Commons statement she said Wednesday\'s attacker was British born and known to police and MI5. The attack was related to \"Islamist ideology\". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the attack as \"an appalling atrocity\". Four people died, including the attacker, with 40 more injured. Mrs May said the victims included 12 Britons, three French children, two people from Romania, four from South Korea, one from Germany, one from Poland, one from Ireland, one from China, one from Italy, one from the US and two Greek people. She told MPs: \"Yesterday an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy, but today we meet as normal, as generations have done before us and as future generations will continue to do, to deliver a simple message: We are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism.\" She said it was still believed that the attacker acted alone and there was \"no reason to believe\" further attacks on the public were planned.\"His identity is known to the police and MI5 and when operational considerations allow, he will be publicly identified,\" she said.\"What I can confirm is that the man was British-born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism.\"He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot.\"Describing it as an attack on free people all over the world, Mrs May thanked global allies including US President Donald Trump for their support.\"We meet here in the oldest of all parliaments because we know that democracy and the values it entails will always prevail,\" she said. \"Those values - free speech, liberty, human rights, and the rule of law - are embodied here in this place but they are shared by free people around the world.\"A terrorist came to the place where people of all nationalities and cultures gather to celebrate what it means to be free. And he took out his rage indiscriminately against innocent men, women and children.\"This was an attack on free people everywhere - and on behalf of the British people, I would like to thank our friends and allies around the world who have made it clear that they stand with us at this time.\"Mrs May also paid tribute to Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood, who tried to save the life of PC Palmer by giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and attempting to stem the flow of blood from his stab wounds in New Palace Yard. And she praised the police for \"heroically\" doing their job by stopping the attacker getting access to Parliamentary buildings by shooting him dead \"within 20 yards of the gate\".\"If his intention was to gain access to this building, we should be clear that he did not succeed,\" she said. She also said it was wrong to describe the attack as Islamic, claiming it was \"Islamist terrorism - it\'s a perversion of a great faith\". Mr Corbyn said MPs were \"united by our humanity, by our democratic values and by that human impulse for solidarity to stand together in times of darkness and adversity\".\"I express my condolences to the family and friends of PC Keith Palmer, who gave his life yesterday in defence of the public and our democracy - and to the loved ones of those still in a critical condition, including the French schoolchildren visiting our capital from Concarneau in Brittany,\" he said.\"The injured include people of ten nationalities. Innocent people were killed yesterday walking across Westminster Bridge as many millions of Londoners and tourists have done before them.\" Conservative MP James Cleverly fought back tears as he paid tribute to his friend PC Palmer, who he met 25 years ago in the Royal Artillery. He asked Mrs May whether the police officer\'s \"gallantry and sacrifice\" could be recognised posthumously - to which she replied, that this would be considered in due course. SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said: \"Today of all days we are reminded, notwithstanding our differences on political and constitutional issues, we are as one in our dedication to democracy, rule of law and harmony between people of all faiths and none.\"He wished Mrs May and Home Secretary Amber Rudd well in their work in the aftermath of the \"appalling, indiscriminate, terrorist act\". Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said MPs were \"beyond thankful to the police, to the NHS, to the emergency services, actually to the staff of this House, in keeping us safe and being so utterly dedicated to their roles\". He said: \"Those who attack us hate our freedom, our peaceful democracy, our love of country, our tolerance, our openness and our unity.\"Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said PC Palmer \"and his colleagues are the reason that we\'re here today and every other day\". Over in the House of Lords, the Archbishop of Canterbury said: \"Yesterday afternoon, one of our own security staff at Lambeth Palace - a Muslim - arrived at the gate having been missed by the vehicle very narrowly, and spent time helping those who\'d been injured.\"It was typical of this community in this country that he refused to go home until the end of his shift, and simply spent the time doing his job as he expected.\" But outside Parliament, UKIP leader Paul Nuttall called on the Muslim community to help cut out the \"cancer within our society of radical Islam\". He said security needed to be heightened, adding that \"all that was needed for this terrorist attack to take place yesterday was a Hyundai 4x4 and a couple of kitchen knives\". Earlier MPs, peers, police and workers around Whitehall observed a one minute\'s silence. Commons deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle said Parliament\'s security committee will hold an emergency meeting later on Thursday to discuss security arrangements on the estate. Speaking beside a police cordon outside Parliament, Mr Hoyle told BBC Breakfast: \"We\'re in a village and our village policeman has been murdered and all of our thoughts are with the family and the other innocent victims.\"But of course the House must continue - we will not give in to terrorism and today we\'ll continue. Mr Hoyle, who is also chairman of the security committee, said: \"We will be having an emergency meeting. We\'ll be getting information - what else needs to be put in place - and we will reflect.\"He said there would be support for MPs and staff who \"witnessed things they never expected to witness in their lives\", he said. Mrs May has spoken to Mr Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in the period since the attack, and will speak to more foreign leaders over the course of Thursday, Downing Street said. The PM\'s official spokesman said Mrs May had been \"focused entirely on this issue since it happened\" and was in constant contact with police and security services. He declined to discuss whether any changes had been made to her schedule for the coming days.',politics
'Technology behind \'all serious crime\' Technology is now at the \"root\" of all serious criminality, says Europe\'s police agency. The returns generated by document fraud, money laundering and online trade in illegal goods helps to pay for other damaging crimes, said Europol. The wider use of technology by criminal gangs poses the \"greatest challenge\" to police forces, It revealed that Europol is currently tracking 5, 000 separate international organised crime groups. Empty houses The \"comprehensive\" study of organised crime in Europe found a wide range of crime groups ranging from loose networks of individual criminals up to large trans-national bodies that generate profits which rival those of legitimate multi-national corporations. Common among all groups was their affection for technology, said the report. The ease with which cybercrime campaigns can be set up and run as well as the proliferation of online crime services had driven this adoption. Many groups now use cybercrime campaigns, including ransomware, to generate cash that is then used to bankroll people and drug trafficking operations. \"These cross-cutting criminal threats enable and facilitate most, if not all, other types of serious and organised crime,\" said the report. In addition, said Europol, many gangs were turning to technology to help make well-established crimes more lucrative. For instance, said the report, drones were now being used to transport drugs and many burglars now track social media posts to work out when people are away from their home . The steady increase in the number of reported burglaries across Europe was a \"particular concern\" for many nations, it said. ',tech

'Business rates a \'ticking time bomb\' for small firms Business rates are a \"ticking time bomb\" for small companies in England which should be offered emergency help, the shadow business secretary has said. Labour\'s Rebecca Long-Bailey said many firms faced \"cliff-edge\" rises when new valuations take effect in April and that the process had been mishandled. The government says it has established a £3. 6bn transitional fund to help businesses facing big jumps in rates. A spokesman said the changes meant all businesses would get a \"fair deal\". However, Ms Long-Bailey said: \"The reality is that business rates are a ticking time bomb. \"It cannot be right for smaller town centre retailers to be facing massive hikes while the Amazons and ASOSs of this world have their business rates cut.\"\'20th century system\' Labour\'s plan would include a fund worth £150m a year for the next three years for small and medium-sized firms at risk of bankruptcy due to \"sharp and unmanageable\" increases. It would be distributed by councils under already established powers to provide discretionary relief, with the cost covered by central government. Analysis: Simon Jack, business editor Although many businesses are expecting small falls in business rates in April, around a third are expecting very sharp rises, with a fifth - mainly in the South East - expecting a rise of more than 40\% immediately - and that is AFTER a government plan to use £3. 6 billion pounds saved by the winners to offset the pain of the losers. The Federation of Small Business is warning than half of those facing hikes will reduce, postpone or cancel investment, with nearly a fifth considering closing down or selling up. Revaluations happen every five years, but the 2015 reset was postponed ahead of the last general election - hence the severity of the moves. Many of the newest and biggest retailers like Amazon and Asos are expected to benefit from reductions in rates on their out-of-town sites. The government has signalled it may find extra money to help the hardest hit. Many small business owners will be watching next week\'s Budget to see if it delivers. In the long-term, Labour said the system should be fundamentally reformed to ease the burden on high streets and town centres. Meanwhile, a survey of 675 members of the Federation of Small Business (FSB) found that almost a fifth of businesses facing higher rates may consider closing their doors. The research suggested more than a third (36\%) of small firms expected their rates to increase, with 44\% expecting bills to eventually rise by more than £1, 000 a year, and just over a fifth expecting an increase of more than 40\%. FSB national chairman Mike Cherry said profitability among small businesses was falling: \"The costs of doing business for small firms are now at their highest levels since early 2014. The last thing we need is a business rates burden so heavy that it threatens the future growth prospects of our entrepreneurs.\"On Monday Ms Long-Bailey will join shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow communities secretary Teresa Pearce for a discussion with business organisations including the FSB, British Retail Consortium and the British Chambers of Commerce. Andrew Silvester, deputy policy director at the Institute of Directors, said: \"This is a 20th century system and in a 21st century economy, it looks painfully out of date.\"Labour also called for business rates to be indexed to the lower CPI measure of inflation rather than RPI and to exclude investment in plant and machinery from future business rates valuations. Christopher Richards, of the Engineering Employers Federation, said: \"The inclusion of plant and machinery in business rates bills represents a tax on productive investment and undermines the international competitiveness of UK manufacturing.\"A government spokesman said: \"The revaluation is designed to bring rates into line with changes in the rental property market and ensures business rate bills more closely reflect the property market and that all businesses are getting a fair deal.\"',business

'Guto Bebb \'despondent\' after Scotland visit A Wales Office minister has described Scotland as \"another country\" after a recent trip to Edinburgh. Aberconwy MP Guto Bebb said he had left feeling \"despondent\" because it reminded him of Dublin. That \"should be a warning when visiting a city which is a crucial part of the UK\", he said. Scotland\'s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that she will seek a Mr Bebb, a Conservative party whip, was in the Scottish capital for a British and Irish council meeting. The meeting brought together the devolved governments from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as the UK and Irish governments. Writing in the North Wales Weekly News, Mr Bebb said: \"We have a huge amount in common with citizens of the Irish Republic, as we do Scotland,\" including similar television programmes, popular music and \"in many ways a shared literature\". But he said \"read their papers, listen to talk shows and watch the news and it\'s clearly another country\". Mr Bebb said leaving Edinburgh made him feel the same way as he does when leaving Dublin.\"For me Dublin is somewhere which is recognisable but very different.\"\"That is fine in the context of the capital of an independent country but it should be a warning when visiting a city which is a crucial part of the UK. He added: \"The sense of nationhood in Edinburgh is palpable. For a long time it has been satisfied within the UK. \"Is that changing though? My gut feeling is yes and that should be a cause for regret to all of us.\"Secretary of State for Wales, Alun Cairns was challenged about his minister\'s comments on ITV\'s Peston on Sunday Programme. He described them as \"speculation in order to develop the debate so that everyone in every part of the UK recognizes that we achieve more together\".',politics
'Jaguar ad \'encouraged unsafe driving\' rules watchdog An advertorial article published in the Guardian about a new Jaguar car has been rebuked by the UK\'s Advertising Standards Authority. The regulator said the story was \"irresponsible\" because it was likely to encourage unsafe driving practices. The text had described drivers using in-built smart technology to check their calendars and use other apps while on the road. A spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover said it was \"disappointed\".\"For all of the connected car technologies we offer our customers, we will always offer what is safe to do whilst driving,\" he added. \"The hands-free technology in the Jaguar XE has been developed and tested to allow users to put their phone safely and legally away, and give priority to focus on the driving experience.\" The ASA acknowledged that using a hands-free mobile phone was not illegal and that the article had stated that the technologies in question could be used \"without compromising safety\". But it noted that the UK\'s Highway Code states that the use of hands-free kit can be a distraction, and that motorists should stop to make or take calls.\"The advertorial featured the headline claim that \'drive time is no longer downtime\',\" it said in its judgement.\"We considered readers would interpret this to mean that drivers could now perform various other tasks while driving.\"The ASA also called attention to an \"early adopter\" of the car interviewed in the piece. Prof David Bailey was quoted as saying he could use apps through the car\'s infotainment system.\"If I need to do an interview while I am going somewhere I can do it on the move and don\'t have to stop,\" he said. The Aston Business School lecturer was surprised when the BBC told him of the ruling.\"I was not told that I was being interviewed for an advertorial, and the comments were part of a much longer interview about driverless cars and the future,\" he said. \"They were certainly not intended to encourage any behaviour that might compromise safety\". On 9 March, the Guardian stating Prof Bailey\'s comments were made \"on a good faith understanding that the comments were for an editorial purpose not a commercial purpose\".\"His interviewer had not been clear,\" it added. \"As an academic, Prof Bailey provides independent commentary on car industry matters but endorses no particular brands.\"A spokeswoman for the Guardian told the BBC it accepted the ASA\'s ruling. The authority has also told Jaguar Land Rover that its future advertising must not encourage drivers to perform tasks that might distract their attention from the road.',tech
'Liverpool teen Ben Woodburn is in Wales squad Teenager Ben Woodburn has received a first call up to Wales\' squad for their World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland on 24 March. The 17-year-old has made seven appearances for Liverpool this season and The Chester-born forward qualifies for Wales through his maternal grandfather and has already played at under-16, under-18 and under-19 level. Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey are also included after returning from injury. Manager Chris Coleman\'s side are third in Group D, four points behind Martin O\'Neill\'s Republic of Ireland, who are top. Forward Bale, 27, has featured in five games for Real after recovering from ankle injury which kept him out of action for three months. Midfielder Ramsey was sidelined for a month by a calf injury but has played in Arsenal\'s last two matches. Coleman has also included striker Tom Lawrence, who has scored 11 goals during a season-long loan at Ipswich Town from Leicester City. The only other uncapped player in Coleman\'s squad is MK Dons defender Joe Walsh, although uncapped Barnsley winger Marley Watkins is named on a stand-by list as Wales have a couple of minor injury concerns. \'Not about England\' Coleman says Woodburn\'s inclusion is not a spur of the moment decision and is not about keeping him away from England.\"Everyone got excited about Ben when he burst into the Liverpool side and said \'we should be looking at Ben Woodburn\', but we\'ve been excited about him since he was 13 years old,\" Coleman said. \"He\'s been in our system for five years, so we know all about him; he\'s done well this season. We are looking forward to having him on board.\"Coleman rejected suggestions England were a factor in the decision to pick Woodburn.\"Absolutely not, that is not the case,\" he said. \"If we want to put him on for tactical reasons, it would be for that, but not because we are worried about anyone else looking at him.\"He has been part of the Welsh set-up since he was a young boy. There will be no knee-jerk reaction to cap him.\"If Ben wanted to go and play for England, there is absolutely nothing we can do about it.\"None of our players belong to us. They aren\'t contracted to us. But he\'s earned this call-up.\"If I thought it was too early I wouldn\'t call him up because this game is massive for us.\"It\'s not about what game is good to get him in, it\'s the best squad. He\'s a Welsh international, he\'s played for us since a young boy and this is a the natural progression for him.\"Wayne Hennessey, Danny Ward, Owain Fon Williams, Ben Davies, James Chester, James Collins, Joe Walsh, Chris Gunter, Jazz Richards, Neil Taylor, Ashley Williams, Joe Allen, David Edwards, Andy King, Tom Lawrence, Joe Ledley, Shaun MacDonald, Aaron Ramsey, Gareth Bale, Hal Robson-Kanu, Tom Bradshaw, Sam Vokes, Ben Woodburn',sport
'Vauxhall-Opel sold by GM to Peugeot-Citroen The French company that owns Peugeot and Citroen has struck a 2. 2bn euro (£1. 9bn) deal to buy General Motors\' European unit, including Vauxhall. GM Europe has not made a profit since 1999 and the deal has raised fears about job losses at Vauxhall. The UK factories at Ellesmere Port and Luton employ about 4, 500 people. With GM\'s Opel and Vauxhall operations, PSA Group would become the second largest carmaker in Europe, behind Volkswagen. , Carlos Tavares, chairman of PSA\'s managing board, said: \"We are confident that the Opel/Vauxhall turnaround will significantly accelerate with our support, while respecting the commitments made by GM to the Opel/Vauxhall employees.\" PSA said it would return Opel and its Vauxhall brand to profit, and expected to make savings of £1. 47bn per year by 2026, with most of the cuts made by 2020. Mr Tavares told the BBC that he trusted the Vauxhall staff to work in a \"constructive manner\" with PSA to improve their performance. \"As long as we improve the performance and we become the best, there is no risk they should fear.\"\'Day and night\' fight One worker at Vauxhall\'s Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire told reporters this morning: \"I think the deal is good for current GM and Vauxhall employees, but is there a future for younger workers after 2021?\"Next year PSA will decide where it will make the next generation of Astra cars currently made in the UK against the background of Brexit negotiations. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said that the union would continue to \"work day and night\" to fight for Vauxhall staff at plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port. Thousands more workers are involved in Vauxhall\'s showrooms and supply chain. \"The current (Astra) model in Ellesmere Port goes up to 2020/2021 but really it\'s this time next year, maybe the middle of next year, (when) we would need to secure acceptance of a new model there. \"That\'s really the challenge for all of us. \"My call to the government is to make certain that our government is at the table, just as the French and German governments will be, batting for their workforce,\" Mr McCluskey said. Brexit effect It has emerged the Prime Minister Theresa May spoke with the chief executive of GM, Mary Barra on Sunday, when she reiterated that she wanted jobs at both plants to be secured for the long term. In a statement, Mrs May\'s office said: Ms Barra made clear that Vauxhall would remain a British brand and that the deal would recognise and respect all agreements regarding the workforce.\" But former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable expressed concerns about jobs because of the government\'s \"lack of commitment to the customs union and the single market\".\"Car components have to go backwards and forwards across frontiers and they will acquire tariffs and checks. \"And Vauxhall is particularly exposed to this, [as] about 80\% of its exports are to the European Union. \"And if you\'re a hard-headed car executive looking at the competitiveness of Britain versus German plants, Britain, I\'m afraid, is going to slip down the ranking in future.\"\'Big mess\' Prof Peter Wells of Cardiff Business School said: \"PSA\'s Carlos Tavares has targeted savings of $2bn per annum so something has got to give.\"PSA will be inheriting quite a big mess, and out of that mess they are going to have to make something that is viable going forward.\"GM chairman and chief executive Mary Barra said it had been a difficult decision to sell Opel and Vauxhall, and insisted the business would have broken even in 2016 had it not been for the UK\'s decision to leave the European Union, which caused a sharp drop in the value of the pound. Analysis Simon Jack, BBC business editor PSA Group says it will cut costs to increase profits, which has stoked concerns for more than 4, 000 Vauxhall jobs in the UK. The new owners met government and unions last week and provided assurance that existing production commitments would be honoured at Ellesmere Port till 2020 and Luton for some years beyond that. However, it is generally accepted that the 24 factories the combined company will have in Europe is too many. The deal is an exit from Europe for GM which has lost billions here since the turn of the millennium. It will allow them to focus on its home market of the US and its expanding operations in China. PSA has said many countries are reluctant to buy French cars and the Opel brand will help them expand into new markets. The chancellor will have extra motivation to be supportive of the car industry when he delivers Wednesday\'s Budget. He is expected to announce investment in skills, research and development around electric car technology in which PSA has so far lagged behind its rivals. ',business
'The woman taking on ticket website Viagogo When Claire Turnham tried to buy Ed Sheeran tickets for her son\'s 16th birthday, she thought it was going to be an \"amazing\" family trip. Instead, she says she was overcharged by £1, 150, and the episode has led her to take up a campaign against Viagogo, the secondary ticket website she used. She set up the to seek refunds for others who feel they have been \"ripped off\".\"It\'s affecting people worldwide and it\'s growing all the time,\" she said. Ms Turnham gave her experiences to a House of Commons select committee hearing about ticket abuse on Tuesday. She said she\'s been contacted by 425 people from 26 countries in the past six weeks who were charged more than they expected and have had \"very frustrating\" experiences trying to get refunds. Birthday surprise backfired Ms Turnham tried to buy four tickets to see Ed Sheeran in Dublin on 12 April - her son\'s 16th birthday.\"I have four children - three of them are massive Ed Sheeran fans,\" she said. \"As their mother I thought it would be an amazing experience for us to be able to go to Ed Sheeran together.\"So I thought, as a surprise for them, that I would try and get tickets. The last time I bought tickets was 10 years ago to Rod Stewart. I\'m not familiar with the secondary market - or I wasn\'t until six weeks ago.\" She looked for tickets on 31 January, when pre-sale tickets for the gig were made available, but had no joy going through Sheeran\'s official site and Ticketmaster.\"I went back onto Google and I found Viagogo at the top of the listings, which said, \'We have tickets today, official site\', and I just went with that.\"Viagogo offers tickets for resale, often at inflated prices. The company declined to send a representative to the select committee hearing and hasn\'t responded to requests for comment from BBC News.\'I didn\'t have the money\' Ms Turnham continued: \"I knew from the research I\'d done that the face value of the ticket was likely to be between £50-£75, so when I saw four tickets for £263 I did a quick mental calculation and thought that sounded about right and I pushed \'buy\'.\"I didn\'t know through any of that process that that price was actually going to be per ticket, and that there were going to be fees on top of that. So actually what it ended up costing was £1, 421.\"The day after this, my rent was due and I knew I didn\'t have £1, 421 in my account.\" The first transaction failed - but Ms Turnham says Viagogo then processed the transaction a different way and she was charged the full amount. She received a refund after much persistence and taking her story to the media. \"When I was offered my refund I was very glad of it,\" she said.\"But I started to become aware that other people had become affected and weren\'t receiving refunds so I started trying to help them... People are contacting me all the time and they\'re very, very distressed.\"She has posted photos on social media of people who have had similar experiences of being charged more than they expected when buying tickets to see stars like Craig David, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga and Adele.\'You have to be strong\' Many people don\'t have the energy to keep chasing refunds, she said.\"You have to be able to be incredibly strong to be able to do this because like any other form of abuse it relies on people being silenced and it relies on people being isolated.\"Viagogo had a seat at the select committee hearing - but it remained empty. Nigel Huddleston MP said Viagogo had written to the committee explaining their absence by saying \"we do not sell tickets\", but instead is a platform for handling tickets. But the company was roundly criticised by MPs and other expert witnesses for its practises, with Nigel Adams MP saying it made \"Stan Flashman look like Mother Theresa\". Ed Sheeran\'s manager Stuart Camp and gig promoter Stuart Galbraith did give evidence and talked about a Sheeran show at the O2 arena in London in June. Emotional and physical stress They said they had written to the four main secondary ticket websites - Viagogo, Seatwave, GetMeIn and StubHub - in advance, asking them not to list any tickets for the show because they would cancel any that were found to have been resold, and fans would not be let in.\"All four sites ignored our requests and all four sites listed tickets at inflated prices, knowing that it\'s our intention to cancel those tickets and not admit their customers.\"Ms Turnham said the threat of not getting in added extra stress to fans who already paid over the odds.\"It\'s causing not only financial effects but serious emotional and physical effects too,\" she said.\"As well as all the money issues and how they\'re actually going to pay for that, it\'s whether or not their ticket is actually going to be valid. As we\'ve heard today, these people who\'ve paid for Ed Sheeran tickets, at these excessive prices, actually may not be able to get in.\"Mr Galbraith offered advice for fans looking for tickets: \"Go to the source. If you\'re buying an Ed Sheeran ticket, go to edsheeran. com because from there you will only be directed to official outlets. The worst thing you could do would be to Google search.\"He also pointed fans toward a new guide to ticket-buying published by .',entertainment
'NI Election: Everything you need to know about the 2017 vote - Northern Ireland went to the polls on 2 March to elect a new government. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) retained its position as Northern Ireland\'s largest party but won only one seat more than Sinn Féin, which was the big winner of the day. But why did Northern Ireland come out for an election in the first place? Here\'s a guide to the circumstances that led up to the 2017 vote. Wasn\'t there an election in Northern Ireland very recently? That\'s right, Northern Ireland already did the election dance last May but we\'re going back to the ballot box just 10 months later. So what happened? Stormont\'s power-sharing government collapsed in January. The collapse came about after . In Northern Ireland, the government must be run by Irish nationalists and unionists together. The system was set up by the Good Friday Agreement following years of conflict. A first and deputy first minister, taken from the largest and second largest parties elected, are appointed to lead an executive of ministers. Although they have different titles, they essentially have equal authority and, in theory, work together in partnership. At the beginning of the year, the first minister was Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster who worked with Mr McGuinness as deputy first minister. But after he resigned, and Sinn Féin refused to nominate a replacement, Secretary of State James Brokenshire had no choice but to call for a new election. Why did Martin McGuinness resign? He stepped down after a row between Sinn Féin and the DUP over a green energy scheme scandal - the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). You can . But, here\'s the short(-ish) version: Mrs Foster was in charge of the scheme when it was set up in 2012. It was designed to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to environmentally friendly alternatives. But, subsidies were over-generous and initially there was no cap on payments - leading to what has been dubbed the \"cash-for-ash\" scandal. The scheme is projected to run £490m over budget, although just before it broke up in January. Sinn Féin asked that Mrs Foster temporarily stand aside while an investigation was carried out, but she refused. So the resignation was just over this scandal? It\'s more complicated than that. While the scheme was the catalyst for Mr McGuinness resignation, he and Sinn Féin have said it was just one of many issues it had with the DUP, including Brexit (which the DUP backed, while Sinn Féin did not), same-sex marriage (to which the DUP is opposed, while Sinn Féin is in favour) and a potential Irish language act. These issues could become very important if the two parties retain their dominant positions as deal makers in March. OK, so what\'s new this time? Well, for one, Martin McGuinness is not back for re-election. A week after resigning, he . in his stead and is leading the party into an election for the first time. Other than that, there\'s a major change in numbers, as less people are going to get elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly - only 90 MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) as opposed to 108 last year. Why the reduction? To reduce costs, . However, the law is being implemented a bit sooner than expected - it was thought the reduction would be introduced for the next scheduled election in 2021. Now, 18 MLAs will lose out less than a year after getting in the Stormont door. How might that affect the results? It remains to be seen, but the big two - DUP and Sinn Féin - are still the parties to beat. They led the power-sharing government after 2016\'s election and have been the big players at Stormont since 2007. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the two other major unionist and nationalist parties, are aiming to usurp them. Last year, these two formed the first official opposition at the Northern Ireland Assembly. Meanwhile the Alliance Party, Northern Ireland\'s fifth largest with eight MLAs elected last year, is a centrist, non-sectarian group that straddles the line between unionist and nationalist. They are hoping to take advantage of any voter dissatisfaction at the DUP/Sinn Féin leadership and are also under new leadership, with . What about smaller parties and independents? They\'ve been bubbling up in recent years. Jim Allister, leader of hard-line unionist party the TUV (Traditional Unionist Voice) has been a fixture at Stormont since 2011, which will be hoping to add to its solitary MLA. Likewise, the Green Party doubled its representation to two MLAs in 2016 and is optimistic of a strong showing. Also look out for anti-austerity outfit People Before Profit, who took their first two seats ever last year and are running even more candidates this time around. How will the election work? A form of proportional representation called Single Transferable Vote (STV) is used to elect candidates to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Voters rank candidates in order of preference. Candidates are then elected according to the share of the vote they receive. You can , or check out this video explainer. OK, so that\'s the state of play. But what will happen after the election? The two biggest unionist and nationalist parties will get together and try to form a new government. If it\'s the UUP and SDLP, then we should see a Stormont government under new leadership in reasonably short order. But, it\'s more likely that once again the DUP and Sinn Féin will be tasked with reaching agreement. And since they spectacularly fell out just a few weeks ago, that could be a challenge... So they won\'t be able to form a government? That remains to be seen. But, Sinn Féin has repeatedly said there will be \"no return to the status quo\", so it appears they will not re-enter government with the DUP without agreement over thorny issues like the failed RHI scheme and the Irish language. It\'s apparent that some in-depth negotiations will be needed if both parties are elected. But the clock will be ticking - those tasked with forming a government have three weeks to agree and appoint an executive of ministers. If they can\'t find agreement on those issues then, technically, there could be another election. Another election - really? It\'s pretty unlikely. Instead, some other way of governing Northern Ireland will have to be found with direct rule from Westminster a real possibility. Nationalists have said that direct rule would be unacceptable, and called for the British and Irish governments to come together to form some kind of \"joint authority\" if the Northern Ireland Assembly cannot be re-established. However, unionists are against this idea while the Secretary of State James Brokenshire has said he is not considering any alternatives to a Northern Ireland Assembly. Whatever happens in Thursday\'s election, it\'s likely to be just the start of Northern Ireland\'s journey back to devolved government. ',politics
'Twitter adds more anti-abuse tools Twitter has introduced more measures aimed at cutting down on the amount of abuse on the platform. Users will be able to limit what they see from certain types of account, particularly ones with no profile picture or information. Such accounts are often set up by trolls. The company said it would act only on accounts that its computer algorithms had thrown up as being abusive.\"Since these tools are new, we will sometimes make mistakes, but know that we are actively working to improve and iterate on them every day,\" said Ed Ho, Twitter\'s vice-president of engineering The updates are the latest in a series of changes Twitter has implemented in recent months. In February, it said it would make it harder for abusive users to create new accounts, as well as launching a safe search function and collapsing tweet replies deemed abusive so they are hidden from immediate view. There has been mounting pressure on social media firms to deal with the growth of extremist propaganda, fake news and harassment on their platforms. Mr Ho added: \"We\'re working to identify accounts as they\'re engaging in abusive behaviour, even if this behaviour hasn\'t been reported to us.\"Then we\'re taking action by limiting certain account functionality for a set amount of time, such as allowing only their followers to see their tweets.\"Nick Thomas, an analyst at research firm Ovum, said: \"Given that cleaning up Twitter is imperative if it is to attract more advertisers to the site, there is pressure not just to act, but to be seen to act - which may explain why they are making multiple announcements.\"',tech
'Premiership: Exeter Chiefs 30-25 Sale Sharks Exeter came from 14 points down to beat Sale Sharks at Sandy Park and boost their hopes of securing a home semi-final in the Premiership play-offs. AJ MacGinty landed four penalties and cross-code star Denny Solomona traded scores with Kai Horstmann to leave the visitors 19-5 ahead after 34 minutes.

'Pound\'s jump unsettles London shares The FTSE 100 closed down amid worries over the impact of a stronger pound and concerns that US President Donald Trump faces opposition to promised reforms. Sterling rose 1\% to $1. 2490 after UK inflation in February rose to 2. 3\%, driven by rising fuel and food prices. The stronger pound weighs on companies that earn their income abroad. At the close, the was down 0. 69\% at 7, 378. 34 points, with mining companies the top five fallers. Glencore was the biggest casualty, falling 4. 24\%, followed by Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, each down about 4\%. However, another miner, Fresnillo led the risers with a 1. 64\% jump. The gold miner benefitted from a rally in the precious metal\'s price, which is now at a three-week high. The London market has risen for the past four trading sessions in a row, notching up three record closes along the way. However, sterling\'s rise to its highest level since 23 February has raised worries about how it may hurt profits when London-listed multinationals repatriate profits back to the UK. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: \"The pound\'s post-inflation increase boost continued into the afternoon, creating a heavier and heavier weight for the FTSE. \"It will be now interesting to see whether the pound can maintain these gains as attention shifts to next week\'s triggering of Article 50, or whether its current highs merely give it more room to fall.\"The mid-cap index hit a record high in early trading, before turning negative.

'Budget 2017: \'Disarray\' over National Insurance rises Labour\'s shadow chancellor says the government is in disarray after Theresa May said Budget tax rises would not go before MPs until the autumn. John McDonnell called it a \"partial U-turn\" over National Insurance increases for self-employed workers. Prime Minister Mrs May defended the change as \"fair\", amid a backlash from some Tory MPs and newspapers. But she said it would not be voted on until after proposals for extra rights for the self employed was published. The review of modern employment practices by RSA chief executive Matthew Taylor will be published in the summer. The prime minister told journalists on Thursday: \"People will be able to look at the government paper when we produce it, showing all our changes and take a judgment in the round.\"Of course the chancellor will be speaking, as will his ministers, to MPs, business people and others to listen to the concerns. The announcement was written up as a \"delay\" and \"concession\" by Friday\'s newspapers due to fears of a potential Conservative rebellion. More than 14 Tory MPs have criticised the move - the government\'s working majority is 16. At a Treasury briefing on Thursday morning, it was suggested the bill could be introduced in the summer. BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said Labour and Conservative MPs had been talking to each other about how they could delay the plans. By saying the vote would be in the autumn, the prime minister had taken the heat out of the immediate political crisis, he added. More than a dozen Conservative MPs have criticised the £2bn National Insurance hit announced in the Budget, including former leader Iain Duncan Smith, John Redwood, Anna Soubry and Dominic Raab. Labour\'s Mr McDonnell said: \"The fact the prime minister won\'t fully support her own chancellor\'s Budget measure, and has been forced by Labour to row back on it just 24 hours after he delivered his speech in Parliament, shows the level of disarray that exists at the top of government.\"Mrs May should \"show some leadership, rather than this partial U-turn, and just scrap these tax rises for low and middle earners altogether\", he said. What is National Insurance? National Insurance is designed as a contribution towards state benefits and services such as the NHS, unemployment benefits, sickness allowances and the state pension National Insurance is deducted automatically from employees\' salaries There are different classes of National Insurance payments, depending on people\'s employment status and how much they earn The self-employed currently pay a lower rate than those in employment The government says this was traditionally down to a lesser entitlement to benefits and pensions, but that these disparities have mostly been removed, so the difference in rates is unfair But critics say it is justified because self-employed people are not entitled to things like paid holiday and sickness leave At a press conference at the EU summit in Brussels, Mrs May said the change would leave \"lower-paid self-employed workers better off, it\'s accompanied by more rights and protections for self-employed workers and it reforms the system of National Insurance to make it simpler, to make it fairer and to make it more progressive.\"The Conservatives\' last general election manifesto explicitly ruled out rises in National Insurance, VAT and income tax during the lifetime of the current Parliament but ministers argue that legislation enshrining the manifesto commitment in law - approved by Parliament in 2015 - referred only to National Insurance contributions paid directly by employers and their employees. However Wales Office minister Guto Bebb said the party \"should apologise\" for the proposed rise, while another Conservative MP, Bob Blackman said: \"It\'s a bit like having a contract, people sign it but don\'t look at the small print. It\'s weasel words.\"It\'s an issue about breaking a manifesto pledge - that\'s what we would be doing.\"And Neil Carmichael, chair of the Commons education committee, said the policy was \"at variance\" with the party\'s manifesto and needed to be changed before being presented to Parliament.\"We need to have a very robust look at the figures so we can actually say to those affected that it is not going to be as bad as it is currently predicted,\" he told BBC Two\'s Daily Politics. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron suggested the prime minister was worried about elections in May.\"Kicking the can down the road for a few weeks shows that the Conservatives are still planning to hit hard-working self-employed people, but that they haven\'t the courage to say so this side of the local elections,\" he said. The change outlined in the Budget will see millions of self-employed workers pay an average of £240 a year more, but ministers say those earning £16, 250 or less will see their NI contributions fall. The change was supported by some economic commentators, who argue it takes account of the growth in the size of self-employment. The Institute for Fiscal Studies while the Resolution Foundation think tank called it \"welcome and progressive\". Its chair, the former Conservative MP Lord Willetts, told Radio 4\'s Today the tax system was a \"living, breathing thing that has to change as circumstances change\".',politics
'SXSW 2017: Disney \'not in the business of scaring kids!\' Ever since , the iconic animated clip from 1928 featuring a mouse that would later become Mickey, Disney has had a proud record of innovating with new technology. It’s rare that the company delves too far into how the “magic” - as they call it - works. Their logic is a magic trick doesn’t get better if you know how it’s done. On Saturday, Disney - quite uncharacteristically - gave us a bit of an insight into how they plan to use technology to bring their much-loved brand of storytelling to new forms, by using robotics and artificial intelligence. Jon Snoddy, the company\'s senior Vice President for research and development, explained how soon you’ll be able to interact with story-telling robots at Disney parks. “I think AI [artificial intelligence] and machine learning is going to be very important for what we do,” he told the BBC. \"Things like characters that can move around among our guests. They’re going to need to understand where they’re going, have goals, and they’re going to have to know how to navigate in a world with humans. \"All these emerging technologies are going to be key to the next generation of entertainment.” During a panel discussion, the company shared footage - which unfortunately we’re not able to republish here - of a robotic Pascal, the cute lizard from 2010 movie Tangled. It’s a terrific recreation of the digital character, but the real challenge for Disney will be to avoid the so-called “uncanny valley” - the theory that if something is very lifelike, but not exactly right, it can be slightly creepy or disturbing. \"Obviously we’re not the business of scaring kids!” Mr Snoddy said. \"That won’t be part of what we deploy. We go and do tests in our parks to gauge the reaction and try and understand what kids find entertaining about these things. Our ability to build these characters at a fidelity that looks like the films is really growing.” When these technologies are fully deployed in Disney parks, and perhaps as toys, Mr Snoddy said Disney will do everything it can to hide the inner technological workings. \"Every new technology that’s come along for the last 60, 70 years we have adopted and co-opted and made it into a story telling medium,” he said. \"This won’t be different. We’re not going to put up a sign that says \'Look! Artificial intelligence\', because no-one would come to see that. They really come to be moved emotionally, that will not change.”',tech

'Bank cheques to be cleared within a day Bank customers who pay cheques into their accounts will soon be able to get the money cleared within one working day. At the moment, the process can take up to six days. The organisation that manages the cheque clearing system said the changes would be phased in from October 2017. However, it will be the second half of 2018 before all UK banks and building societies are able to offer the faster service. Under the , co-ordinated by the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company, banks will be able to clear cheques by exchanging pictures of them. At the moment, all cheques have to be physically transported back to the bank that issued them.\"These changes will put cheques firmly in the 21st century, delivering real and important benefits for the many individuals, charities and businesses that regularly use cheques,\" said James Radford, chief executive of the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company.\"Not only will cheques clear faster but banks and building societies may offer their customers the option of paying in an image of a cheque rather than the paper cheque itself.\" Barclays already allows some of its customers to pay in cheques via pictures on their banking apps. However at the moment they have to be cheques issued by Barclays. Although cheque use has declined in recent years, there were still 477 million written in the UK last year. The industry had wanted to phase them out entirely by 2018. However MPs said they should be retained, as many older people in particular relied on them. ',business
'Meera Syal: TV\'s portrayal of British Asians has \'gone backwards\' Meera Syal has voiced her frustration at how the portrayal of Asians on TV has \"slightly gone backwards\". The writer and comedian said TV should not just feature South Asian characters in dramas like BBC One\'s Three Girls, about the Rochdale abuse scandal.\"Of course it\'s not like those things don\'t happen,\" the Goodness Gracious Me star told Radio Times.\"But if that\'s all that TV is doing, it looks like that\'s the only thing Asians do. It\'s a problem.\"Three Girls is based on a child sexual exploitation ring that saw nine men, mainly of Pakistani origin, . Syal made her name in the 1990s as one of the stars of sketch show Goodness Gracious Me and is also known as a screenwriter and as an author of novels including Anita and Me. Asked whether TV had made progress in showing Asians in Britain, Syal replied: \"I think we\'ve slightly gone backwards.\"Some of the stuff I\'d want to have on TV wouldn\'t get on at the moment. It\'s a conservative climate with lots of period pieces and lots of nostalgia.\"When people think of stuff with South Asians in, it tends to be programmes like the upcoming Rochdale abuse drama.\"She added: \"If there were five or six or seven shows on TV featuring South Asians, then absolutely Rochdale is a worthy subject to investigate - but it\'s about context.\"We should also be thinking about stories that just show us as people, not issues.\"\'Changing slowly\' for women Asked whether TV had got better at depicting women, she said broadcasters could take a leaf out of theatre\'s book by looking beyond traditional casting. Television is \"changing, but needs to change a little quicker\", she said.\"In theatre there\'s lots of cross-gender casting, like Tamsin Greig playing Malvolio in Twelfth Night at the National. And in Elementary, the US version of Sherlock Holmes, Watson is played by an Asian American [Lucy Liu].\"It would be nice if it happened a bit more in Britain because it can unlock something terrific.\"Goodness Gracious Me returned for a special to mark the 50th anniversary of BBC Two in 2014, and Syal revealed that it may return again - but not necessarily as the same type of show.\"We don\'t want to redo something for the sake of it, but we\'re discussing something,\" she said.\"We\'d like to bring our brand of humour back but in a different format. We have to be confident we\'ve got the material and I think we have. We\'re gathering it. That could well happen.\"Syal will be heard on the radio next, starring in new BBC Radio 2 comedy Parental Guidance on 13 March. ',entertainment
'Conservative Party fined £70, 000 over election expenses The Conservative Party has been fined a record £70, 000 for breaking election expenses rules. The party insists its failure to report six figure sums it spent on trying to win three by-elections and the general election was an \"administrative error\". The there was a \"realistic prospect\" the money had given the party an advantage. The Metropolitan Police is now looking at the evidence to see if the reporting omissions were deliberate. The party broke spending rules by moving campaigners and staff from its national headquarters to boost local party efforts and not properly declaring their hotel bills and expenses. The investigation, which followed \' investigation, found: The Conservative Party\'s 2015 UK Parliamentary general election spending return was missing payments worth at least £104, 765 Separately, payments worth up to £118, 124 were either not reported to the commission or were incorrectly reported by the party The party did not include the required invoices or receipts for 81 payments to the value of £52, 924 The party failed to maintain records explaining the amounts it invoiced to candidates in three 2014 by-elections, for work on their campaigns The successful Conservative campaign in South Thanet to see off a challenge by then UKIP leader Nigel Farage at the 2015 general election was among those criticised in the commission\'s report. The Electoral Commission found the Conservative Party also failed to correctly report all expenditure on a national battlebus campaign, which helped David Cameron win a majority at the general election. It has referred a possible criminal offence - of whether Simon Day, the Conservative Party\'s registered treasurer until April 2016, \"knowingly or recklessly made a false declaration\" - to the Metropolitan Police. Labour and the Lib Dems have previously been fined for breaking election spending rules prompting the Electoral Commission to warn that \"there is a risk that some political parties might come to view the payment of these fines as a cost of doing business\". Speaking at a charity event in London on Thursday evening, Mr Cameron said he had won the general election \"fairly and squarely\", and that he was happy with a statement made earlier by Conservative head office. The Conservatives said \"there needs to be a review of how the Electoral Commission\'s processes and requirements could be clarified or improved\". Analysis - by Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg Seventy thousand pounds is a lot of money, but in the context of a political campaign where millions of pounds are spent, it\'s not exactly going to break the Tories\' bank. But the political cost of what might happen next is much higher. Thirteen police forces are now looking at whether the mistakes made might constitute criminal offences. If that was to happen, there could be by-elections in seats around the country, that could seriously affect the PM\'s unhealthily slim majority in Parliament. And the whiff of financial wrong-doing is an odour no political party wants. But how likely is that actually to happen? Senior Tory sources tell me they think it\'s unlikely the mistakes, and there were plenty of them, will reach the hurdle for the prosecution. The CPS has to believe there is a good chance of a successful conviction, and while this is speculation, senior Tories don\'t believe in most of the cases that\'s likely. The Commission\'s chief executive Claire Bassett told BBC Radio 5 live the investigation had taken much longer than necessary because of \"some difficulties\" in getting information from the Conservative Party. She added that having had to get a court order to get information was \"very disappointing\". Electoral Commission chairman Sir John Holmes said: \"Our investigation uncovered numerous failures by a large, well-resourced and experienced party to ensure that accurate records of spending were maintained and that all of the party\'s spending was reported correctly.\"He added that failure to follow the rules \"undermines voters\' confidence in our democratic processes\". But senior Conservative MP Oliver Letwin said that spending record \"mistakes\" were probably down to \"human error\". \"I don\'t think you should conclude from this that there is some great conspiracy,\" he told BBC Radio 4 Today\'s programme. The Electoral Commission\'s investigation covered the national party rather than spending by individual candidates, which local police forces have been looking into. have asked the Crown Prosecution Service to consider charges over election expenses. BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said that if prosecutions go ahead \"we could be looking at by-elections\". In response to the Electoral Commission report, a Conservative spokesman said it had \"complied fully... and will pay the fines\".\"This investigation and these fines relate to national spending by CCHQ, and the Conservative Party\'s national spending return for the 2015 general election. \"As we have consistently said, the local agents of Conservative candidates correctly declared all local spending in the 2015 general election.\"CCHQ accepted in March 2016 that it had made an administrative error by not declaring a small amount constituting 0. 6\% of our national spending in the 2015 election campaign. \"Political parties of all colours have made reporting mistakes from time to time... this is the first time the Conservative Party has been fined for a reporting error. \"We regret that and will continue to keep our internal processes under review to ensure this does not happen again. \"Given the range of technical errors made by a number of political parties and campaign groups, there also needs to be a review of how the Electoral Commission\'s processes and requirements could be clarified or improved.\"UKIP\'s chairman Paul Oakden said: \"As UKIP has always said, the laws are in place in order to ensure that big and wealthy political parties cannot buy British politics.\"',politics
'London-Paris electric flight \'in decade\' A new start-up says it intends to offer an electric-powered commercial flight from London to Paris in 10 years. Its plane, yet to go into development, would carry 150 people on journeys of less than 300 miles. Wright Electric said by removing the need for jet fuel, the price of travel could drop dramatically. British low-cost airline Easyjet has expressed its interest in the technology.\"Easyjet has had discussions with Wright Electric and is actively providing an airline operator\'s perspective on the development of this exciting technology,\" the airline told the BBC. However, significant hurdles need to be overcome if Wright Electric is to make the Wright One, pictured above, a reality. The company is relying heavily on innovation in battery technology continuing to improve at its current rate. If not, the firm will not be able to build in enough power to give the plane the range it needs. The company is yet to produce a plane of its own and is instead working alongside American inventor Chip Yates, whose own electric aircraft, the Long-ESA, holds the world record for fastest electric aircraft. Wright Electric\'s competitors include aviation giant Airbus, which has been developing its electric two-seater plane E-Fan since 2014, and has stated plans to create its own short-haul electric aeroplane seating 70 to 90 passengers.\'Less loud\' Wright Electric is backed by Y Combinator, Silicon Valley\'s most highly-regarded start-up incubator programme. Alumni of the scheme include companies such as AirBnB, file storage company Dropbox and HR management software firm Zenefits. Wright Electric\'s goal, detailed in a presentation given to potential investors on Tuesday, is to make all short-haul flights electric-powered within the next 20 years, which would be about 30\% of all flights made globally. The company said that as well as lower fuel costs for the airlines, the technology could have a major added benefit for the public.\"Depending on how it\'s designed, you can have an electric plane that\'s substantially less loud than a fuel plane,\" said Jeff Engler, Wright Electric\'s co-founder. Batteries would be charged separately, he said, meaning planes would not have to sit on the tarmac while power is replenished. \"The way we\'ve designed our plane is to have modular battery packs for quick swap using the same cargo container that\'s in a regular airplane,\" Mr Engler said. \"We want it to be as fast as possible, so airlines can keep their planes in the air as long as possible and cover their costs.\"Other technology start-ups are seeking to innovate within the aviation industry. Boom, a company backed by Sir Richard Branson, is developing a Concorde-like supersonic jet. It hopes to achieve London to New York in three-and-a-half hours, a journey which currently takes more than eight hours. It is expected to run test flights later this year.',tech
'Football League Division Three: Armagh and Antrim secure wins Armagh moved to within a point of top spot with a 3-15 to 0-11 victory over Louth side in Drogheda. Armagh defender Aidan Forker and Louth\'s Anthony Williams were sent-off early in the game. Goals from Ciaran McKeever and Rowland helped Armagh to a 2-5 to 0-6 half-time lead and Jamie Clarke added the third. Antrim eased their relegation worries with CJ McGourty netting in a 1-10 to 0-11 win against Laois, who had Damien O\'Connor red-carded before half-time. Conor Murray scored two points at Corrigan Park as the Saffrons moved into an early 0-4 to 0-1 lead, but Ross Munnelly and David Conway were on target as Louth levelled. Turning point The decisive period in the game came just before the break with McGourty\'s goal and the dismissal of O\'Connor. Antrim led 1-5 to 0-6 at half-time but Laois levelled on the restart thanks to points from Ambrose Doran and Alan Farrell. Paddy McBride restored the host\'s advantage only for James Finn to make it all-square again. CJ McGourty slotted over three of Antrim\'s final four points as they edged clear to clinch a valuable win to leave the Ulster side sixth in the standings.\"If we didn\'t get the two points from this game we would be up against it,\" said Antrim joint-manager Gearoid Adams. \"CJ McGourty led by example with pressure frees and we got over the line - we must push on now.\"There was a dramatic opening at the Gaelic Grounds with Forker red-carded after 50 seconds followed by McKeever\'s goal and the exit of Williams on 10 minutes.

'Google apologises after ads appear next to extremist content Google\'s European boss has apologised after adverts from major firms and government agencies appeared next to extremist content on its YouTube site. It came after Marks and Spencer became the latest firm to pull its online ads over the issue, joining others such as Audi, RBS and L\'Oreal. Google\'s European chief, Matthew Brittin, promised to review the firm\'s policies and strengthen enforcement. But some questioned the company\'s commitment to tackling the issue. A recent investigation by the Times found adverts from a range of well-known firms and organisations had appeared alongside content from supporters of extremist groups on YouTube\'s video site. An advert appearing alongside a video earns the poster about £6 for every 1, 000 clicks it generates, meaning brands may have unwittingly contributed money to extremists. The Times said that rape apologists, anti-Semites and hate preachers were among those receiving payouts. Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent There are two difficult issues for Google here - spotting videos that are illegal and should be removed from YouTube, and determining which are legal but not suitable for advertising. Pressed by reporters on whether the firm would employ people to actively hunt down extremist videos, Matt Brittin was evasive, indicating that a combination of smart technology and user alerts to harmful content was a better option. But his main challenge will be in providing more clarity to customers when it comes to deciding which videos are \"ad-safe\". Drawing the line won\'t be easy - as he pointed out, news organisations put a lot of disturbing content online but need to earn money from advertising if they are to continue to invest in journalism. Mr Brittin seems confident that by having a thorough look at its policies and showing advertisers how they can control where their messages appear, Google can regain their confidence. But the company, which insists it\'s a technology platform not a media business, is finding it ever harder to hold that line. Media firms face tight regulation - and that is what may be coming Google\'s way if it doesn\'t clean up its act. Last week, ministers summoned Google for talks at the Cabinet Office after imposing a temporary restriction on the government\'s own adverts, including for military recruitment and blood donation campaigns. And on Monday M&amp; S joined a growing list of firms to suspend their advertising from both Google\'s search engine and YouTube site. Others include McDonald\'s, HSBC, Lloyds, the BBC, Channel 4 and the Guardian.\'Not far enough\' Speaking at the Advertising Week Europe conference, Mr Brittin said: \"I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content.\"He also promised that Google would exert more control over where ads were placed and improve its record for reviewing questionable content. Further details are expected later this week. However, Labour MP Yvette Cooper told the Guardian the apology had not gone far enough.\"They need to say whether they will be paying back any of that advertising revenue and to answer our questions on what more they are doing to root out extremism or illegal activity on YouTube because they are still failing to do enough to remove illegal or hate-filled content from YouTube.\"Brian Wieser, an analyst at the brokerage Pivotal, meanwhile downgraded Google\'s stock on Monday, saying the scandal would curtail its profits this year.\"Alphabet\'s Google is facing a serious issue in the UK with brand safety issues, which has global repercussions,\" he wrote in an analyst note. Mark Mulligan, a media and technology consultant at Midia, told the BBC that the complaints against Google \"were not new\" and showed the internet was \"still in its adolescence\".\"When the internet was founded, it was all about doing away with the gatekeeper. But now we\'re facing fake news and inappropriate content and that clashes with business models like Google\'s which are built on selling advertising.\"He said Google was likely to weather the storm, but that such incidents would weaken its dominance of the online advertising market. \"Every incident like this gives Facebook an opportunity to steal a march on Google,\" he said.

'Is big-budget television threatening cinema? Sitting in a trailer on the set, the producer of Netflix\'s The Crown declines to tell me how much it all costs. But a member of the crew later chortles that they \"spent £750, 000 yesterday\". It looks like a film, costs as much as a film and, according to executive producer Andy Harries, is \"filling a big gap in the market\". But one of the leading film producers in the UK, whose work includes Bridget Jones and Love Actually, says super-TV has made his job more difficult. Andy Harries says he is creating a \"viewing experience that is somewhere beyond top-end television and much nearer to big-budget feature films\". It is filling a gap in the market, he says, created by \"traditional Hollywood\'s\" focus on the teenage market. \"The kind of dramas we make for Netflix and for Amazon are filling a big gap in the market; people who used to go to the cinema but don\'t much nowadays.\"\'All the money goes on screen\' \"Cinema watching in the traditional way is definitely in decline. Television is growing partly because of the physical quality of televisions these days.

Is this a threat to cinema? Is the talent rushing to work for the small screen instead? Tim Bevan, co-founder of Working Title, the UK\'s largest film production company, says his job has been made more difficult. He says Netflix and Amazon have arrived in the marketplace \"aggressively\". They are commissioning dramas \"that actors, directors and writers are finding very attractive\", he says. His films have been \"squeezed by the availability of acting talent\" because of these series. \"The area of film business that Working Title works in, which is the quality medium budget movie, has certainly been impacted by this. Because they\'re telling similar stories but also it\'s become competitive\", Bevan says. He also notes that almost every critically acclaimed screenwriter has a television series in the works. \'Scale doesn\'t matter\' But for Matt Smith, who plays Prince Philip in The Crown, it\'s not about size. \"The scale of it doesn\'t matter. It\'s always about the quality of the writing.\"These programmes are \"attracting a better quality of people than before because of the time and the format that you can tell a story in television. It is enticing for people who are auteurs,\" Smith says.\"If you could make Doctor Who for £10m an episode or £20m or £50m will it make it any better? For me it\'s not any different.\"',entertainment
'Farage-Carswell knighthood row \'passed to UKIP NEC\' The row over whether MP Douglas Carswell blocked an attempt to get Nigel Farage a knighthood is being referred to UKIP\'s National Executive Committee, the BBC understands. Mr Carswell, the party\'s only MP, has denied trying to stop an honour for ex-UKIP leader Mr Farage. Mr Farage accused the MP of \"working for the Conservatives\" and called for him to be expelled from the party. But Mr Carswell, who defected from the Tories in 2014, said: \"I\'m 100\% UKIP.\"The BBC\'s assistant political editor Norman Smith said the decision on Mr Carswell rests with the party\'s ruling 18-strong National Executive Committee. He added that he had been told the MP\'s future would depend on his \"attitude\". On Tuesday reported that in an email about the attempt to get a knighthood the MP had suggested Mr Farage should settle instead for an OBE for \"services to headline writers\". Mr Farage was asked about his row with Mr Carswell on BBC Radio 4\'s Today on Wednesday, saying that he was \"not particularly\" interested in a knighthood. He said: \"He (Mr Carswell) has been working against us since the referendum... working with his Tory friends.\"Mr Farage said that he had wanted to \"get rid\" of Mr Carswell, who won the Clacton seat at the 2015 election, for a very long time. He said he did not want a seat in the House of Lords and thought it unlikely he could be offered a post with US President Donald Trump. Mr Carswell said he had an \"amicable\" meeting on Tuesday with party chairman Paul Oakden and was happy to continue to represent UKIP in the Commons. He said: \"Contrary to a lot of speculation, we had a very polite and amicable meeting. I think he has done a wonderful job as party chairman.\"Meanwhile, UKIP donor Arron Banks suggested on Tuesday he could stand against Mr Carswell at the next election.

'Children\'s messages in CloudPets data breach An open database containing links to more than 2 million voice messages recorded on cuddly toys has been discovered, cybersecurity researcher Troy Hunt has revealed. The messages were created by owners of CloudPets soft toys. At one point, the data was even held to ransom, Mr Hunt says. The animals are advertised as being toys that enable people to record and send greetings via a phone app and the toy itself. The creatures are marketed as cuddly devices to connect children to working parents or grandparents. They are currently on sale for a heavily discounted £6 in UK children\'s store The Entertainer but are listed at $29. 99 on the CloudPets US website. In a statement, California-based Spiral Toys, which makes the animals, said it was notified about a potential breach in February and \"took immediate and swift action\".\"When we were informed of the potential security breach we carried out an internal investigation and immediately invalidated all current customer passwords to ensure that no information could be accessed. \"To our best knowledge, we cannot detect any breach on our message and image data, as all data leaked was password encrypted.\"It added that it is now requiring users to choose \"new, increased security passwords\" and has sent out emails informing customers of the potential compromised login data. Password: Cloudpets The website NetworkWorldTroy Hunt that the voice recordings were stored in the cloud and the database, which was left exposed on the net, reveals their exact location. He also expressed concern that there were no password rules at all, meaning lots of people had selected passwords that were extremely easy to crack.\"Because there were no rules, lots of people created bad passwords,\" he told the BBC.\"I did an exercise and found it was really easy to create them. Lots of people were using the password Cloudpets because that\'s what people do.\"There appeared to be around 820, 000 accounts visible. Both Mr Hunt and British security researcher Ken Munro said the toy showed similar vulnerabilities to the Cayla doll, an internet-connected toy that was found to be easily breached and could even be hacked to spy on its owners. German watchdog the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has now advised parents who own a Cayla doll to destroy it. Like Cayla, there is no Pin number required to sync CloudPets with other devices, Ken Munro explained.\"If you have a CloudPets bear, switch it off,\" he said. \"It might be a good idea for people to try to delete their accounts - it\'s possible that the recorded data might go. \"Try to remember what password you set for the account - and if you used it anywhere else, change it.\"',tech

Wiltshire was WSL 2\'s top scorer when she stopped playing 13 weeks into her pregnancy, with her goals helping the Glovers win promotion to the top flight as champions.\"It has panned out well for all parties,\" said Edwards after his wife scored twice in her first start for Cambridge, which came just six weeks after giving birth.\"She hasn\'t had to return to the highest level straight away, instead she has had an opportunity to play at a good level and one where she can find her feet and fitness.\"It has helped me and the club having her around and what Yeovil end up getting will be a more confident and fitter individual.\" Throughout the latter stages of her pregnancy Wiltshire was a constant presence at her husband\'s training sessions, as she wanted to keep her skills sharp - even though the diminutive forward had slowed down considerably by that stage.\"I did a little bit of training,\" she said. \"I just wanted to keep my technical skills up and only lose fitness really.\"I tried to stay on the ball for as long as possible. At 35 weeks I was really big and wouldn\'t really be able to do anything.\"\'A new motivation\' From the early surprise of pregnancy to playing on through the first trimester, staying active in the third and plotting her return to action, Wiltshire has been able to seek guidance from health professionals and fellow footballers. Helen Ward, a Wales and Yeovil team-mate, helped fire Reading to the top tier in 2015 having begun the season on maternity leave before returning for the end of the season. On Saturday she and will miss the club\'s first top-flight campaign. Yeovil manager Jamie Sherwood is also well versed in having expectant mothers on the books, with his own wife and former player Katie twice returning to the sport to play internationally after the birth of their children.\"As a coach, manager and even more as a friend I made sure Sarah was correct on and off the pitch - we made a medical team and sports psychologist work with her to make sure she was okay,\" said Sherwood.\"Now she is coming back, I know exactly what the player needs. It is exciting she is playing again and she is ahead of schedule.\"She wants to be playing, she lives and breaths football. It is her first love, which I\'m sure will be overtaken by daughter - but she is a footballer at heart.\" Wiltshire admires those footballers who have returned to the pitch as mothers before her, and now she is determined to set a lasting example for her daughter.\"That little baby motivates me in a way,\" said Wiltshire. \"I want her to grow up knowing she can chase her dreams.\"Having a baby does make you feel like you can do anything. Since I started playing football it was always my dream to play at the highest level and to get to do that with Yeovil, a club the means a lot to me, is my goal. \"I have a little one that is my whole world now, she makes me happy and when I\'m happy and playing football, that makes me play better.\"\'It takes a lot of juggling\' Francis\' return to elite-level sport so soon after childbirth was a little more unexpected, as she was recalled to Team Bath as an injury replacement earlier in March, having initially opted just to train with the West Country side after squad sizes were trimmed from 15 players to 12. The three-time Superleague champion admits the conversation with coaches about her playing future was a hard one, with the season coming so soon after Paige\'s arrival. \"It was a difficult decision for me,\" she admitted. \"I didn\'t want to commit to being in the 12 then find out that I really couldn\'t cope with it.\"We don\'t have family nearby, I didn\'t know if I was going to be fit or what I would have been like, so I was lucky enough that I could be a training partner.\"I wasn\'t personally expecting anything this season. I was just looking forward to training, getting some fitness back and doing what I love doing.\"\'It\'s tough - but definitely worth it\' She has gone on to feature in three of Team Bath\'s six matches so far this season, admitting it takes a lot of teamwork to coordinate life with husband Rob - something they worked hard at when she first returned after Elise\'s birth in 2014.\"During the season you do almost sacrifice seeing each other because he works evenings,\" said Francis.\"It\'s a lot to juggle and you have to have a lot of people around you who are willing to help out.\"With Elise, she breastfed for 11 months so when I did start that season she was still feeding, so my husband and Elise had to travel with me to play.\"Paige is bottle-fed, which is a little more freedom. If she was feeding from me, that potentially would have been a game changer because of the amount of time I would have had to spend away from her, or asking Rob and Elise to travel to away games with me, which would have been a bit more difficult.\" And some things about being an elite athlete and parent of a toddler and newborn just do not tally - namely peace and quiet.\"The big difference is the amount of recovery time I have,\" said Francis. \"During the week, if sessions are changed to afford us more rest or a lie-in, that is not the reality of my situation.\"If I\'m lucky, Paige has a nap and I might get an hour\'s kip. If I\'m up in the night then Elise is awake in the day wanting to play, then we have got to play.\"Afternoon swimming lessons with Paige, followed by evening training sessions, mixed in with those all-important play dates with toddler Elise is a snapshot of a hectic day in the life of Francis. Every moment of which she relishes.\"If you want it bad enough, you definitely can have children and make the most of what you really enjoy doing,\" she said. \"It is tough and tiring, but it definitely worth it.\"',sport
'Eurozone growth nears six-year high, survey data suggests Eurozone businesses grew at the fastest rate in nearly six years in March, led higher by France and Germany, a closely-watched survey has indicated. The latest rose to 56. 7 from February\'s 56. 0. A reading above 50 indicates growth. The findings signalled the bloc\'s recovery was \"surging higher\", the report\'s authors said. Job creation was at its best level for almost a decade, they added. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: \"The eurozone economy\'s throttle opened further in March, with business activity and hiring surging higher.\" The PMI measures companies\' trading activity, giving a good idea of how well the underlying economy is performing. French growth Fuelling the growth were strong performances from France and Germany\'s services sectors, the survey found. \"Perhaps the best news came from France, where growth has risen above that seen in Germany, led by strengthening domestic demand,\" Mr Williamson said.\"While elections remain a worry regarding the outlook, for now the business mood in France and across much of Europe is very positive.\"Economists said the PMI data could encourage the European Central Bank (ECB) to move towards raising interest rates and further easing its monthly bond-buying programme.\"Strong eurozone PMIs increase chances for first ECB exit package in June. A package, no action, though,\" said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at German bank ING-DiBa.‎Frederik Ducrozet, senior economist at Pictet, said the ECB would wait for inflation to pick up further and see the outcome of the French presidential election before making a decision. Analysis - Glimmer of light By Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent Is it finally looking like a half decent recovery? Let\'s not get carried away. There\'s the scar of Greece. There\'s persistent unemployment, especially among young people. The eurozone youth unemployment rate is one in five, and it\'s a lot higher than that in several countries. And the economy is supported by the ultra-easy money policies of the European Central Bank; a negative interest rate and quantitative easing. There are also persistent problems nagging at the eurozone banking system. That said, the jobs situation has been moving in the right direction and inflation has risen to a level that has surely dispelled the ECB\'s worries about the dangers that can come from deflation or falling prices. It does look like a small if still uncertain glimmer of light on the eurozone\'s economic horizon.',business
'Oscars 2017: Truth behind \'Envelopegate\' emerges The man in charge of the Oscars awards envelopes has been blamed for the gaffe that saw La La Land named best picture. PriceWaterhouseCoopers accountant Brian Cullinan was supposed to hand the best picture envelope to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway on Sunday., PwC said he \"mistakenly handed [them] the back-up envelope for actress in a leading role instead.\"It\'s also emerged that Cullinan tweeted a picture of Emma Stone backstage just minutes before the mix-up took place. The tweet has since been deleted, though it survives on various websites and on a cached Google page. Cullinan had a complete set of envelopes on one side of the stage, while Martha Ruiz, another PwC accountant, had a duplicate set on the other. This explains why both best actress winner Emma Stone and Beatty ended up in possession of an envelope related to the best actress award. Beatty was evidently confused by the contents of the envelope, passing the card onto his former Bonnie and Clyde co-star. Seeing the words \"La La Land\" beneath Emma Stone\'s name, Dunaway declared her musical romance the winner of the best picture award. Only after that film\'s producers had begun their acceptance speeches was it revealed that Moonlight had in fact won the award.\"Once the error occurred, protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr Cullinan or his partner,\" said the accountancy firm. One of Cullinan\'s colleagues that the accountant \"feels very, very terrible\" and \"is very upset about this mistake\". The mix-up brought a chaotic end to Sunday\'s Oscars ceremony, hosted in Los Angeles by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. Here are six more things we\'ve learned about one of the most extraordinary awards show debacles in recent times. 1) The Academy is really, really sorry The organisers of the Academy Awards \"deeply regret the mistakes\" that led to La La Land being wrongly named best picture. Moonlight had actually won the award, but the envelope mix-up led to Dunaway announcing the wrong film.\"We apologise to the entire cast and crew of La La Land and Moonlight whose experience was profoundly altered by this error,\" . \"We salute the tremendous grace they displayed under the circumstances.\"In its statement, the Academy said PwC had \"taken full responsibility for the breaches of established protocols that took place during the ceremony.\"We have spent last night and today investigating the circumstances, and will determine what actions are appropriate going forward.\"2) It was all down to Trump President Trump and his policies were at the forefront of many attendees\' minds on Sunday, with Gael Garcia Bernal among those to take issue with them on stage.\"As a Mexican, as a Latin-American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, I\'m against any form of wall that separates us,\" the actor said - a reference to Trump\'s plans to build a border wall between Mexico and the US. In his first comments on the Oscars, the president has suggested the awards \"were focused so hard on politics that they didn\'t get the act together at the end\".\"It was a little sad,\" he told the . \"It took away from the glamour of the Oscars. It didn\'t feel like a very glamorous evening.\"I\'ve been to the Oscars,\" continued the president. \"There was something very special missing, and then to end that way was sad.\"3) It didn\'t help the ratings The extraordinary end to Sunday\'s ceremony came too late to help boost the show\'s ratings, which were its smallest for almost 10 years. ABC\'s broadcast drew 32. 9 million viewers in the US - a 4 per cent drop on the 2016 Oscars, which were seen by 34. 4 million people. It was the smallest audience since the 2008 ceremony, which drew an average audience of 32 million. Despite the decline, the Oscars are still expected to be the most-watched non-sporting event on US TV this year. 4) Kimmel was meant to end the show with Matt Damon Back in his usual slot on late night television, Jimmy Kimmel revealed that he had originally intended to end the show in the audience, sat next to actor Matt Damon.\"We\'re sitting there and we notice some commotion going on,\" the Oscars host explained on Monday\'s edition of Jimmy Kimmel Live. \"And Matt says, \'I think I heard the stage manager say they got the winner wrong.\' \"So you just kind of, well, the host will go onstage and clear this up. And then I remember, oh, I\'m the host.\"\"Have any of you here ever hosted the Oscars before?\" Kimmel asked his audience. \"Well, except for the end - it was a lot of fun.\'\'The result, he joked, \"was the weirdest TV finale since Lost\" - a reference to the long-running US drama series about strangers stranded on a tropical island. 5) Faye Dunaway\'s heels may have been involved According to Tuesday\'s Daily Mail, Beatty and Dunaway were meant to have descended a staircase before presenting the final award of the evening. But the paper claims the 76-year-old had difficulty climbing up the stairs in her high heels, so the pair started their presentation walk at the foot of the stairs instead.\"It\'s unclear whether this confusion contributes to the ensuing chaos,\" the paper\'s report continues. 6) The US State Department also had Twitter issues The US State Department\'s official Persian-language Twitter account tweeted congratulations to the Iranian people and Asghar Farhadi after the director\'s film The Salesman won the best foreign language film award. That was despite Farhadi, who did not attend the ceremony, having a speech read out in which he described President Trump\'s travel ban as \"inhumane\". A State department spokeswoman said the tweet was deleted \"to avoid any misperception that the USG [US government] endorsed the comments made in the acceptance speech.\"',entertainment
'Theresa May: SNP has independence \'tunnel vision\' Theresa May has accused the SNP of having \"tunnel vision\" over independence as she insisted that \"politics is not a game\". But the prime minister refused to be drawn on whether or not she would grant permission for a second referendum. She was speaking to BBC Scotland ahead of her speech at the Scottish Conservative conference on Friday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mrs May\'s government had \"no mandate\" in Scotland. And she accused the UK government of \"obstinacy and intransigence\" in its dealing with the devolved administrations ahead of the formal triggering of the Brexit process, which is expected to happen later this month. The which sets out proposals it believes could allow Scotland to remain in the EU single market even if the rest of the UK leaves - with Ms Sturgeon saying a second independence referendum is \"all but inevitable\" if that does not happen. Mrs May said she was \"looking very closely\" at the proposals and said the issues raised had been taken on board. She said her objective was to use the Brexit negotiations to secure a \"good trade agreement that works for the whole of the UK, but crucially a trade agreement that works for Scotland as well\". And she said it was wrong to say she backed a so-called \"hard Brexit\", but that she instead wanted \"a Brexit that is going to be right for the United Kingdom, and that means being right for all parts of the United Kingdom\". She also said it was \"very clear\" that people in Scotland did not want another vote on independence - but did not say whether she would grant permission if the Scottish Parliament called for a second referendum. Mrs May added: \"I can\'t help but feel that the SNP has a tunnel vision about independence. Actually I think what people want is for the SNP government to get on with dealing with the issues they want to see addressed on a day-to-day basis.\"Issues like the state of the economy, reforming schools - education used to be such a great flagship for Scotland, but sadly in recent years we have seen that deteriorating.\"\'Grave challenge\' Mrs May said she was \"passionate\" about preserving the United Kingdom and pointed out that . In a speech earlier this week, Ms Sturgeon warned that elements of farming and fishing policy could be taken back to Westminster after Brexit, despite promises by the Leave campaign that they would be handed to Holyrood. She said devolution was facing a \"grave challenge\" after \"20 years of progress\". But Mrs May said \"no powers that are currently there will be taken away, but more could come\" to the Scottish Parliament after Brexit. She added that there were some areas would need to stay at a UK level. In response, Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government had offered \"substantial concessions\" over Brexit in its dealings with the UK government, which she said had shown \"no similar willingness to compromise but has in fact hardened its position over Brexit\". \'No mandate\' She added: \"If the prime minister thinks she can come to Scotland and sermonise about where power should lie, in the manner of one of her Tory predecessors, she should remember this: Her government has no mandate in Scotland, and no democratic basis to take us out of Europe and the single market against our will.\"But increasingly, this Tory government seems to think it can do what it wants to Scotland and get away with it.\"In her speech at the two-day Scottish Conservative conference in Glasgow, Mrs May will highlight her commitment to \"strengthening and sustaining the bonds that unite us\" and say she is confident about the future of the UK. She will also praise the work done by Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who she will say has successfully \"exposed the SNP\'s mismanagement of Scotland\'s schools\". The Conservatives are currently the second-largest party in the Scottish Parliament, having overtaken Labour in last year\'s election.',politics
'Elderly \'hit by line rental charges\' Recent increases in line rental charges have hit elderly people the hardest, according to . Between December 2009 and December 2016, line rental prices had increased by as much as 49\% for some customers, the regulator said. And of the people with standalone landlines in their homes, 71\% were aged 65 or over. to make BT - with nearly 80\% of the UK market - cut line rental costs by £5. A huge proportion (43\%) of the 2. 9 million households with a landline only are occupied by people aged 75 and over. \"Older consumers are particularly affected, as they are more likely to be dependent on fixed voice services if they do not have a mobile phone or an internet connection,\" the report said. Ofcom also said it was \"concerned\" BT\'s low cost option for landline-only customers on certain qualifying benefits - - had not been taken up by many of the households that could apply for it. The service costs £5. 10 per month and provides customers with line rental and calls worth £1. 50, with free calls at weekends to 0845 and 0870 numbers (up to 60 minutes). \"We... are working with BT, the Department for Work and Pensions and other organisations to raise awareness,\" Ofcom said. In a statement, BT said it had recently frozen line rental costs for customers with a phone line. The firm added that customers had enjoyed changes including \"a faster fault repair service, the launch of our free nuisance calls prevention service BT Call Protect and bringing call centre work back from India to the UK\". Rise in access Elsewhere in its report, Ofcom detailed new evidence for the increasing uptake of internet access among elderly people and people with disabilities. One in five people with disabilities is still without such access, however, making them \"much more likely than the population as a whole to face exclusion issues as a result of not being online\".\"Life costs more if you are disabled,\" said James Taylor at disability charity Scope, who called for more to be done to get people with disabilities online. The combined cost of higher energy bills and specialist equipment reaches on average £550 per month, according to Scope research.\"The internet provides access to tools to compare prices, access to the best deals and offers, and information which can help disabled people be savvier shoppers,\" added Mr Taylor. And elderly people continued to be frustrated by encouragements to use services online, instead of in person or via the phone, said Sally West at the charity Age UK. In particular, having to adapt to how technologies changed thanks to frequent software updates was an example of how digital life could be off-putting for those in later years, she said.\"Every time there\'s an update of an operating system or something like that - that\'s a struggle for everybody - but if you\'re new to using a computer or tablet, you can be thrown when things change,\" Ms West told the BBC. But while vulnerable people still faced difficulties and rising costs associated with some of their services, those who used home broadband and mobile data plans were getting an increasingly better deal, . Some of the changes highlighted include: The average cost of mobile plans including 500 minutes, 200 texts and 5GB of data fell from £57 in 2012 to £40 in 2016 People are spending less on telecoms services such as broadband and are getting more in return - with data usage up from 8GB in 2008 to 97GB in 2015 The cost of the cheapest home broadband bundles has fallen by 25\% since 2009 ',tech
'World Cup 2018: Andy Robertson sets sights on victory over England Andy Robertson has targeted a win over England to make Scotland genuine contenders to reach the 2018 World Cup. A on Sunday kept the Scots\' hopes alive but they remain fourth in qualifying Group F, two points adrift of Slovakia in second and six behind leaders England. Defender Robertson thinks the nation can really start to believe if Scotland beat England at Hampden on 10 June. \"If we pick up points in that game we\'re right back in it,\" he said.\"We\'re only two points off second and we have a massive game coming up against England at home. If we show that tempo and desire you never know what happens.\"England maintained their dominance of Group F with a at Wembley on Sunday, and Scotland\'s recent record against their neighbours makes for grim reading. They in the current campaign, and of the last 10 meetings between the sides Scotland have managed just one win and one draw. But Robertson took heart from a slick showing against Slovenia. It took a late Chris Martin goal to win it but Scotland undoubtedly deserved the three points and should have scored more.\"From what I remember that\'s the best we\'ve played in a while, especially first-half,\" left-back Robertson said. \"I think they only had one shot on goal in the whole game and that\'s what we\'ve been asking for.\"It does feel like a big win, and there was a bit of pressure on us. We put the pressure on ourselves, we said it was a must-win and didn\'t hide away from that. The gaffer and the players, we all said it was must-win so we\'re glad we got the three points and it opens up the group a bit.\"Robertson faced Slovenia in his usual position but fellow left-back Kieran Tierney switched across to right-back, a move that raised eyebrows before kick-off.\"People were probably doubting whether one of us could play right-back but we were both confident we could do it,\" Hull\'s Robertson said. \"I thought KT was brilliant out there, even though it\'s uncomfortable for him, but that didn\'t show and I thought I played well as well. As a defensive unit the whole back four played well.\"Winger Robert Snodgrass was also hugely encouraged by the performance on Sunday night, and felt the Scots got back to what they are good at.\"It was a relief in the end, but I was delighted in the way we played,\" the West Ham player said. \"I thought we were great. First-half we were brilliant, we passed it and moved, we created chances and if Leigh [Griffiths] takes a couple of those chances it could\'ve been a comfortable night.\"Slovenia are a big physical side and it was up to us to go and trust ourselves on the ball. The other night against Canada we never trusted each other on the ball and I think that\'s sometimes when you get that losing mentality, you sort of lose faith in what the aim is.\"',sport
'Intel buys driverless car technology firm Mobileye US chipmaker Intel is taking a big bet on driverless cars with a $15. 3bn (£12. 5bn) takeover of specialist Mobileye. Intel will pay $63. 54 a share in cash for the Israeli company, which develops \"autonomous driving\" systems. Mobileye and Intel are already working together, along with German carmaker BMW, to put 40 test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. Intel expects the driverless market to be worth as much as $70bn by 2030. Jerusalem-based Mobileye has contracts with 27 car makers. It also controls about two thirds of the market for software that runs automatic emergency braking and semi-autonomous cruise control systems already fitted to cars and trucks. Technology companies are racing to launch driverless cars. Earlier this month, Nissan test drove a converted Leaf vehicle and said it hoped to make the cars available by 2020. Google has also done extensive development of driverless cars. Announcing the deal, Intel said that as cars \"progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels\". The chipmaker reckons that by 2020 driverless cars will generate 4, 000 GB, or 4 terabytes, of data a day that can be mined for information. Betsy Van Hees, analyst at Loop Capital Markets, said Intel had very little presence in the automotive market, \"so this is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities\". Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University academic, said: \"Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution.\"Shares in Intel fell 2. 2\% to $35. 10 in New York. Mobileye was founded in 1999 to develop \"vision-based systems to improve on-road safety and reduce collisions\". The company, along with Intel\'s automated driving group, will be based in Israel and led by Amnon Shashua, Mobileye\'s co-founder, chairman and chief technology officer. In its results for last year, Mobileye said revenue more than tripled to $358m, while pre-tax profit jumped from $79. 7m to $125. 4m.',business

To mark the centenary, her record label projected her photograph onto the white cliffs of Dover - but a Spitfire fly-past was scrapped due to bad weather. Asked for advice on ageing, she said: \"Be active to your full capabilities.\"Keep interested, read books, watch television and try to keep in touch with life and what people are doing, seeing and enjoying.\"Speaking to BBC Radio 2, she added: \"While you can do that, I hope you will continue.\" Dame Vera became known as the \"forces\' sweetheart\" during World War Two for travelling to conflict zones around the world to give morale-boosting performances to British troops.

They also serenaded her with a selection of her best-loved hits including We\'ll Meet Again and The White Cliffs of Dover. Speaking from her home in Ditchling, East Sussex, she thanked the pupils and recalled her \"very good memories\" at the school.

'EU migrants should have skills, public tells BBC Wales poll Nearly three-quarters of Welsh voters think only EU citizens with the right skills should live and work in a post-Brexit UK, a BBC Wales poll suggests. Over half - 57\% - of those questioned felt MPs should support the referendum result, while 24\% said they should take account of their constituents\' view on Brexit and 17\% their own conscience. On the economic impact, 44\% thought it would be negative and 33\% positive. Meanwhile a majority of 60\% said Donald Trump\'s state visit should go ahead. Only 38\% wanted the UK government to withdraw the invitation to the new US president. On the freedom of movement to live and work in the UK post-Brexit, the poll showed 74\% agreed that only those EU citizens with the \"right\" skills or qualifications should be allowed in, with 19\% believing that nothing should change and just 6\% wanting the door firmly shut to EU immigrants. When questioned about the impact of Brexit on the Welsh economy, 44\% thought it would have a negative impact with 33\% saying it would be positive. When it came to personal finances, 17\% thought Brexit would be positive, 30\% negative and 45\% thought it would make no difference at all. Martin Boon of ICM Unlimited, which carried out this year\'s St David\'s Day poll for BBC Wales, said: \"With the triggering of Article 50 likely to be no more than a month or so away, the decision to leave the EU still has the power to somewhat mystify. \"Wales voted marginally to leave, and this BBC Cymru Wales data confirms that the public probably did so despite knowing that it would harm the Welsh economy and their own personal finances.\"He added: \"What\'s been described as \'project fear\' may not have been convincing in comparison to immigration and control arguments, but that doesn\'t mean it failed to get through: 44\% think the Welsh economy will be negatively impacted and 30\% think their own finances will suffer - both being higher than those who think that positive outcomes will accrue. \"Despite this acknowledgement, \'carry on\' is the main message that people in Wales want Theresa May to hear.\" On devolution, the poll showed Welsh voters are keen for the Welsh Government to take more powers over day-to-day life in Wales but do not want an increase in the number of assembly members elected to Cardiff Bay. Only 27\% of those questioned want to see an increase, with 43\% saying the current total of 60 AMs is sufficient - 26\% believe fewer AMs are actually needed. Asked to choose their preferred option for the future of devolution, 44\% said they wanted an assembly with greater powers - an increase of one percentage point on a year ago. This option has been the most popular in every BBC Wales poll since it was first asked in this format in 2010. The status quo is preferred by 29\%, down one point from last year, with 3\% wanting an assembly with fewer powers, and 13\% wanting the assembly abolished. That figure has remained stable since the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014, having previously been as high as 23\% in March 2014. However, only 6\% back the idea of Welsh independence, unchanged from the polls in 2015 and 2016. Support has been under 10\% since 2011. The poll also found: 60\% know the Welsh NHS is run by the Welsh Government, with 32\% thinking the UK government is in charge. In a 2014 BBC Wales poll only 48\% identified the correct answer. On health, 64\% of those questioned believe the Welsh Government should spend more on the NHS, with 32\% believing current spending is about right. The Welsh Government currently spends just under 50\% of its £16bn budget on the NHS. Despite a string of bad news stories on education, more than half (55\%) think schools in Wales provide a good standard of education with only 17\% saying it is poor ',politics
'Google\'s fake news Snippets Over the weekend, I put a question to the Google Home speaker I\'d brought back from the United States. \"OK Google,\" I said. \"Is Obama planning a coup?\" I\'d asked this after reading an article that suggested a relatively new feature that gives answers - or Snippets as the search company call them - to queries, rather than just links, had been producing some troubling results. asking which US presidents were in the Ku Klux Klan had listed several as members of the KKK, despite there being no evidence for that. It also featured a search for \"Proposition 63\", a gun control measure, that had produced a Snippet describing it as \"a deceptive ballot initiative that will criminalise millions of law abiding Californians\". And then there was \"Is Obama planning a coup?\" which had resulted in a Snippets box describing \"Western Center for Journalism\'s exclusive video\". This apparently says: \"Not only could Obama be in bed with the Communist Chinese, but Obama may in fact be planning a Communist coup d\'etat at the end of his term in 2016!\"Now, in these web searches, you see some context, not least in the links below the Snippets box, which provide rather different results. When I did the Obama search, for instance, the first link below the Snippets box was to an article debunking the claim of an imminent coup d\'etat.

'Ben Woodburn: Will Liverpool youngster make Wales senior debut? Ben Woodburn has only seven senior career appearances to his name, just one goal and has yet to start in the Premier League. With an international break on the horizon, however, the 17-year-old\'s future is a major talking point. Wales travel to Dublin to face the Republic of Ireland in a crucial 2018 World Cup qualifier on Friday, 24 March, and, two days earlier, England play a friendly against Germany. Woodburn is eligible to play for both Wales and England and, while it is unlikely he will feature for the latter in the near future, Wales are believed to be considering a first senior call-up for the Liverpool forward. The teenager shot to prominence in November when he became the youngest scorer in Liverpool\'s history with a goal against That prompted talk of between Wales and England for his services and, since that landmark goal, he has started three FA Cup games and impressed in his league appearances from the bench. Wales manager Chris Coleman names his squad for the Republic of Ireland match on Thursday, and his assistant Osian Roberts says Woodburn is \"knocking on the door\" for selection. \'Get him in there\' Woodburn was born in Nottingham on 15 October, 1999, making him eligible to play for the country of his birth, England. Having a maternal grandfather born in Wales, however, means he has played and impressed for Wales at under-16, under-18 and under-19 level. He pledged his future to Wales, caught the eye as they in the Under-19 Euro 2017 qualifiers and his ambition was to \"replicate\" the feats of Welshmen Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey. There may be an opening in the Wales squad to face the Republic of Ireland - behind Bale and first-team regulars Sam Vokes and Hal Robson-Kanu, there is scope for a young forward to stake his claim for a place. Woodburn may not have the experience of fellow hopefuls such as Ipswich loanee Tom Lawrence but, according to former Wales centre-back Danny Gabbidon, he has the ability and versatility to make an impression.\"Get him in there. Not just to keep him out of the clutches of England, I think he\'s ready,\" Gabbidon told BBC Wales Sport.\"I remember Gareth Bale coming into the squad when he was 16 and the whole squad thinking \'Oh my god, look at this player, he\'s unbelievable\'.\"I think he [Woodburn] would have a similar effect on this squad now.\"He\'s so intelligent for a 17-year-old. His decision-making, he seems to be able to play in different positions - he can play out wide, as an inside forward, up front or as a 10.\" \'This is not a game for youngsters\' While the fanfare around Woodburn grows, some are eager to strike a more cautionary note. Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland midfielder Ray Houghton is excited about the 17-year-old\'s prospects, but he does not think Wales\' trip to Dublin is the time to hand him his senior debut.\"I\'m not sure this is one for youngsters coming in,\" he told BBC Wales Sport.\"I think what Chris Coleman will be looking at is his tried and trusted. He will be looking at players who have done well for him over the last two years or so - because he knows the knows the importance of the game.\"I don\'t think it\'s going to be one where you put in a youngster...[but] Woodburn has got a fantastic future in the game.\" Houghton\'s warning will make pleasant reading for Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. When Liverpool secured Woodburn on what was only described as a contract in November 2016, the German was effusive in his praise the player.\"Wow, what an exciting talent he is,\" he said at the time. But after Woodburn\'s goal against Leeds, Klopp was eager to keep a lid on expectations.\"I\'m afraid about all you in the media. That\'s why I\'m so quiet,\" said Klopp.\"We know how to handle the situation.\"The situation regarding Woodburn\'s international future now lies with Coleman and the player himself. The cauldron of a pivotal World Cup qualifier in Dublin may not be the ideal setting for Woodburn\'s senior debut but, with England potentially waiting to pounce, Wales will not want to risk losing such a promising talent.',sport
'Zero hours contracts reach record levels The number of people on controversial zero hours contracts has reached a record high of 910, 000. New figures based on an analysis of Office for National Statistics data reveal that 105, 000 more people were on contracts that do not guarantee work in 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. That\'s an increase of nearly 14\%, and 30\% higher than 2014. In 2005, there were just 100, 000 people on zero hours contracts (ZHCs). But although the new figures are a record, they also reveal a sharp slowing in the rate of increase in the last six months of 2016. \"It\'s notable that the increase of 0. 8\% in the second half of 2016 compares to a 7. 7\% rise over the same period in 2015,\" said Conor D\'Arcy, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, which undertook the analysis of the ONS\'s Labour Force Survey.\"Ever since ZHCs hit the headlines the numbers have increased sharply every six months. The latest figures bring this run to an end.\" That decline in the rate of increase for such contracts - which have been criticised for being forced on lower paid workers - could be down to three reasons. First, as the levels of employment reach record highs, people looking for work can be more demanding about the type on contracts they sign. The number of people on zero hours contracts rose rapidly after the financial crisis as employers sought to cut costs and be more flexible and employees were more concerned about losing their jobs. Second, as the UK approaches full employment, the number of new jobs being created - whether full time or zero hours - is slowing. The third reason appears to be business reputation. After controversies over zero hours contracts at companies such as Sports Direct, a number of businesses have either stopped using them or reduced their use. Homebase, the DIY chain, scrapped zero hours contracts earlier this year. And JD Wetherspoon, which runs pubs, offered thousands of staff on ZHCs the chance to move onto contracts which guarantee hours. Exploitative? Although zero hours contracts have been controversial, many say they provide flexibility to people such as students, parents and those with other caring responsibilities. The employee - who still receives employment rights such as annual leave - does not have to accept work offered.\"We shouldn\'t dismiss all ZHCs as exploitative,\" Mr D\'Arcy said.\"Over the past year, approaching half of the increase has been among workers aged 55-64.\"For many of these workers, ZHCs could offer a flexible transition from full-time work to retirement, allowing them to top up their incomes.\"Neither are they all low-paid positions: one in six ZHC workers are in the three highest-paying occupation groups.\"Bottom line But the government is concerned that \"precarious working\" is undermining the tax base as people on zero hours contracts are generally less well paid and more reliant on in-work benefits.\"Workers on ZHCs appear to face a significant pay penalty - typically earning £1, 000 less annually than similar workers - as well as being more likely to be underemployed,\" Mr D\'Arcy said.\"From a living standards perspective, both are troubling.\" The government is likely to make the issue of zero hours contracts and the gig economy - where people take on \"self-employed\" work for companies like Uber - a key issue in the Budget next week. Both have been blamed for . The Treasury is likely to announce further steps towards \"balancing\" the amount of tax paid by the self-employed and those on short term or zero hours contracts, so that they pay similar levels of tax to those in full-time, guaranteed employment.',business
'George Michael died of natural causes George Michael died as a result of heart and liver disease, a coroner has confirmed. The pop star was suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver, according to Darren Salter, senior coroner for Oxfordshire.

Thames Valley Police originally said his death was unexplained but not suspicious and an initial post-mortem examination was \"inconclusive\". On Tuesday, the coroner said in a statement: \"Inquiries into the death of George Michael have been concluded and the final post-mortem report received.\"As there is a confirmed natural cause of death, being dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver, the investigation is being discontinued and there is no need for an inquest or any further enquiries.\"No further updates will be provided and the family requests the media and public respect their privacy.\"The medical terms used on death certificates outline the cause of death, but not all the risk factors that have led up to it. George Michael\'s lists three conditions: dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and fatty liver. This means his heart was enlarged, weakened and inflamed. The muscle wasn\'t doing the job of pumping blood as well as it should have. His liver was also abnormal, containing unhealthy collections of fat. There are many possible causes for this - heavy alcohol use is one. At the weekend, the singer\'s former partner Kenny Goss was quoted as saying: \"I think his body just gave up. All these years, it was just weak.\": \"We just want closure, we want the funeral to happen, it\'s been a long time now.\" Fadi Fawaz, the singer\'s partner at the time of his death, in late December he had found the star \"lying peacefully in bed\".

'Brexit: Civil service \'needs more staff\' The government has been warned that the civil service has failed to recruit enough extra staff to deal with Britain leaving the European Union. The National Audit Office said that there were still hundreds of posts to be filled, days before Brexit negotiations are scheduled to begin. Prime Minister Theresa May is due trigger on Wednesday. The head of the civil service, Sir Jeremy Heywood, said it was \"well placed\" to deal with challenges ahead. In , the NAO, which scrutinises government spending, said Brexit would \"further increase the capability challenges\" facing a civil service already struggling to cope with major projects. It said the government must show \"greater urgency\" in filling skills gaps in Whitehall. \'Not confident\' Its report said a third of the 1, 000 roles created in the new Department for Exiting the EU and the Department for International Trade had yet to be filled as of February. And the posts that had been filled were done so \"mostly by transferring staff from elsewhere in government\". The spending watchdog said many of the specialist skills needed for the negotiations were in short supply and departments were competing against each other to recruit the right staff. National Audit Office chief Amyas Morse said the government must prioritise its activities and be ready to stop work on projects \"it is not confident it has the capability to deliver\". He said: \"The civil service is facing ever-increasing challenges.\"The work of government is becoming more technical, continuing budgetary restraint is putting pressure on departments and the decision to leave the EU means government will have to develop new skills and take on work previously done by others.\"Government has gaps in its capability and knows it must do more to develop the skills it needs. It is making plans to do so but the scale of the challenge ahead means greater urgency is needed.\"Rob O\'Neill, of the senior public servants\' union the FDA, said the report was \"a wake-up call for ministers\".\"Departments are being asked to take on more and more work even as staff numbers fall while ongoing pay restraint chips away at their ability to recruit and retain the brightest and best.\"But the head of the civil service, Sir Jeremy Heywood, said the organisation could cope with Brexit and the government\'s other priorities.\"We are focused on delivering this government\'s commitment to leave the EU and get the very best deal for the UK. \"We are equipping ourselves with the right people and the right skills across government to make this happen,\" he said.',politics

'Bill Gates tops Forbes\' rich list but Trump\'s wealth slips Microsoft founder Bill Gates again tops Forbes\' list of the world\'s richest people, in a year when the number of billionaires rose 13\% to 2, 043. According to the magazine\'s annual rich list, Mr Gates\' fortune rose to $86bn, from $75bn, followed by investor Warren Buffett, up $14. 8bn to $75. 6bn. It was bad news for US President Donald Trump, who slipped 220 spots to 544 and must now rub along on just $3. 5bn. Forbes said the $1bn fall in his wealth was due to the slow US property market. There were 183 tech billionaires , with a combined $1tn in wealth. The list is dominated by US billionaires. Others in the top 10 included Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who moved up to number three with the biggest gain of any person on the planet, a $27. 6bn rise in his fortune of $72. 8bn. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was number five and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison was number seven. The global population of billionaires, now put at a record 2, 043, marks the biggest annual increase in the 31 years since the magazine began compiling the list. The number of US billionaires on the list was 565, which Forbes attributed to the recent stock market surge since Mr Trump\'s November 2016 election. China was second with 319 billionaires, and Germany was third with 114. Bill Gates (Microsoft co-founder): $86bn Warren Buffett (US investor): $75. 6bn Jeff Bezos (Amazon founder): $72. 8bn Amancio Ortega (Inditex founder): $71. 3bn Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook founder): $56bn Carlos Slim (Mexican magnate): $54. 5bn Larry Ellison (Oracle co-founder): $52. 2bn Charles Koch (US businessman): $48. 3bn David Koch (US businessman): $48. 3bn Michael Bloomberg (Bloomberg founder): $47. 5bn The number of women on the list rose to 227 from 202, giving them a collective net worth of $852. 8bn. For the second year running France\'s Liliane Bettencourt, the L\'Oreal cosmetics heiress, was the world\'s wealthiest woman with a $39. 5bn net worth. Most of the richest women inherited their fortune, Forbes said. But the list also contained 15 new \"self-made\" women, mostly from Asian countries, including Vietnam\'s Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao of budget airline VietJet air. Trump\'s tumble Forbes attributed the US president\'s slide down the list to the sluggish Manhattan property market, which is responsible for a disproportionate amount of his wealth. \"Forty percent of Donald Trump\'s fortune is tied up in Trump Tower and eight buildings within one mile of it,\" Forbes said. \"Lately, the neighbourhood has been struggling - relatively speaking.\" The magazine also said that his wealth was hit by $66m in political spending on his successful presidential campaign, as well as $25m to settle litigation he allegedly ripped off students at Trump University. Mr Trump would also have missed the big Wall Street rally following his election, assuming he sold off all of his shares during last year\'s campaign, the magazine said. But not all of the trends were negative for Mr Trump. The magazine estimated the worth of the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida rose $25m due to post-election exposure.

He added: \"There is huge potential to deliver increased economic growth in north Wales. A modern, high quality integrated transport system is fundamental to achieving that potential and I am committed to working to make that a reality.\"According to Welsh Government stats about 20, 000 workers cross the border from England into Wales each day.

Eoin Bradley had given Coleraine the lead in the 27th minute by following up to score after his penalty had been parried out by keeper Tim Allen.

Earlier this week, CBS that The Big Bang Theory\'s new spin-off, Young Sheldon, will be a prequel focusing on the character\'s early years. But will it work? Some spin-off shows have been hugely successful - but there have also been quite a few flops. Here\'s a round-up of some of the best and worst: Frasier is one of television\'s most successful spin-offs. It lasted for 11 seasons and notched up 264 episodes - just behind its predecessor Cheers, which managed 270. The Kelsey Grammer sitcom continued the story of radio psychiatrist Frasier Crane. Digital Spy\'s TV editor Morgan Jeffery thinks the change in tone contributed to its success.\"Frasier had a different style and sense of humour to Cheers,\" he says. \"A spin-off needs to look and feel different. A lot of bad spin-offs are just watered down versions of the original.\"The change certainly worked wonders for Frasier - the sitcom broke an Emmy Awards record, winning 37 over the course of its run (although the record was later beaten by the pesky Game of Thrones). While Breaking Bad centred on characters played by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, corrupt lawyer Saul Goodman (played by Bob Odenkirk) developed something of a cult following. Better Call Saul, which began in 2015, was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, the brains behind Breaking Bad. The Times\'s TV critic Andrew Billen thinks focusing on a less prominent character can often make a spin-off more likely to succeed.\"Most shows are not Marvel Comic universes, they\'re built around one or two heroes,\" he says. \"But if you take a minor character, there\'s more chance of succeeding. Then you\'re into something much nearer to a Hollywood franchise.\"Jeffery agrees: \"Angel is a good example of a character who maybe wasn\'t getting the screen time when he was on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, so he was given a show where there was more space to explore that character.\" Happy Days certainly knows a thing or two about spin-offs - it had seven. Seven! The most successful were Mork &amp; Mindy, which starred Robin Williams; and Laverne &amp; Shirley, which was fronted by Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams. The latter, which first aired in 1976, focused on two single room-mates (who had been friends of Fonzie\'s in the main show) who work as bottlecappers in a Milwaukee brewery. It ran side-by-side with Happy Days, and by its third season had become the most popular TV show in the US. The show was cancelled in 1983, but it still managed an impressive eight seasons. As one of the most successful sitcoms in television history, Friends was ripe for spin-off when it ended in 2004. Only Matt LeBlanc stuck with the character that made him famous, and Joey was launched that September. But it didn\'t go down well with fans, and viewing figures were low. It was cancelled after two seasons, with the final eight episodes not even making it to air.\"Matt LeBlanc was fantastic in [Friends] but he was playing a caricature,\" Billen says. \"I\'m not sure there was enough complexity to Joey as a character, he was more of a clown, and it\'s difficult to build a show around that premise.\"Jeffery adds: \"I don\'t feel there was a clear creative vision behind Joey, they just wanted to keep the Friends train going for a few more years.\" When it comes to spin-offs, Billen describes The Mary Tyler Moore Show as \"the mother of them all\". He explains: \"It was so successful, the best friend Rhoda, played by Valerie Harper, got a spin-off. And the neighbour and landlady Phyllis also span off, but the really significant one was Lou Grant.\"In the original show, Mary Tyler Moore\'s character worked in a TV station in the newsroom, and the news editor [Grant] then span off into a drama series. It ran many seasons, and was a post-Watergate view of investigative journalism.\"Including the original, that totals an impressive four shows in the Tyler Moore universe. Ask a British sitcom fan what their favourite shows of all time are, and it\'s likely Only Fools and Horses will figure highly on their list. It\'s slightly less likely they\'d choose The Green Green Grass, the Fools spin-off that began in 2005 and focused on Boycie and his wife MarleneIt managed 32 episodes but was cancelled in 2009 after continuing negative reviews from critics. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation began in September 2002 and was hugely popular with audiences. So popular, in fact, that it sparked CSI: Miami, CSI: NY and the more recent (and less successful) CSI: Cyber. Jeffery says the CSIs \"work on a business level because you\'re giving people more of what they enjoyed before\". CSI: Skegness surely only a matter of time. Jeffrey thinks it could be just the right time for The Big Bang Theory to get the spin-off treatment.\"I believe it\'s close to being renewed again but it doesn\'t feel like it\'s got too much life left in it,\" he says. \"It\'s probably got a couple more seasons before the cast try and shoehorn themselves out of the show.\"\'s Stuart Heritage put it slightly more bluntly, writing that the announcement of Young Sheldon means \"The Big Bang Theory has officially started its death spiral\". Big Bang may well be ripe for a spin-off, but its makers will have to tread carefully.\"There\'s absolutely no guarantee a spin-off will work better than any brand new comedy or a brand new programme,\" cautions Billen.\"It will give you ratings for the first couple of episodes, and after that it sinks or swims on its own merit.\"',entertainment
'Indyref2: A question of when, not if Nicola Sturgeon has hardly made a secret of her belief that Scotland\'s different attitude to the EU possibly justifies a second independence referendum. At Westminster and Holyrood in recent months there\'s been a building sense that she has made up her mind to call a vote. Those close to her are careful to emphasise that there is no final decision. She, herself, is at pains to say she has not reached a conclusion. But even if it\'s still an \"if\", she seems clearer on the \"when\". In a documentary tonight, the first minister told me the \"common sense time\" for such a vote would be in autumn 2018. Others have speculated as much, but she is in charge. And her more explicit remarks display how expectation is building. If Ms Sturgeon is now willing to discuss the timing of a second vote in public, consideration of another independence referendum is far beyond the hypothetical. The crucial facet of that calculation is that the SNP believes its best chance of winning is before the EU negotiations are complete. Senior sources suggest Theresa May will be at her most vulnerable when the UK government is consumed with the Brexit negotiations, and that if Scotland is to be offered independence again, that choice must be made before the UK has actually left the European Union. There is though not just the problem that just as her supporters may be enthused, many other Scots will be enraged by being asked to go there again. Just as the first independence referendum galvanised Scottish politics, for others it was divisive, even distressing. But also, it\'s up to the Westminster government to permit another referendum. There are huge risks for them in denying it, but ministers in London certainly would not grant a vote at the time of the SNP\'s choosing without a fight. My interview with Nicola Sturgeon will be broadcast on on BBC 2 at 21. 00 GMT. I have also spoken to Boris Johnson, David Davis and Tony Blair among others.',politics
'Windows 10 to offer update \'snoozes\' Microsoft will enable Windows 10 users to choose when security updates are installed once they arrive rather than enforcing them straightaway. Users have complained that the reboots required for some updates, which cannot currently be deferred, are disruptive. People using Windows 10 devices will now be able to schedule an update within three days of receiving notification, the firm said in a blog. However, delaying security updates can be risky, experts say. Apple customers can already delay Mac Operating System updates or opt for them to be automatically installed overnight - which includes carrying out any essential reboots. The change to Windows, part of a project called Creators Update, came in response to complaints about enforced reboots, said John Cable, a director of program management at Microsoft.\"What we heard back most explicitly was that you want more control over when Windows 10 installs updates,\" . \"We also heard that unexpected reboots are disruptive if they happen at the wrong time.\"The three-day window is designed to give people more control over when updates occur - and they can also change the time they have chosen while they are waiting. As part of Creative Update, Microsoft is also exploring changes to privacy settings, Mr Cable said.\'Enemy of security\' Cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, said that delaying updates could help hackers.\"I\'m not 100\% sold on the idea precisely because quite often these updates have critical security fixes in them, and you really want them on people\'s machines as quickly as possible,\" he told the BBC.\"Once a critical flaw gets understood by hackers they will be out there trying to exploit it.\"Convenience and complexity are often the enemy of security.\"',tech
'Seamus Coleman: Republic and Everton star has surgery after double leg break Republic of Ireland skipper Seamus Coleman has had surgery following a horrific leg break in Friday\'s goalless draw against Wales. The Everton full-back, 28, suffered tibia and fibula fractures in his right leg following a bad challenge from Neil Taylor, who was given a red card.\"Seamus suffered a serious leg injury and has undergone surgery,\" said Republic manager Martin O\'Neill. Coleman was given oxygen before being carried off at the Aviva Stadium. The Donegal man was taken straight to St Vincent\'s University Hospital immediately after the incident and had surgery on Saturday morning. \"Captain Seamus Coleman, who went off injured during the game, underwent surgery on Saturday morning after fracturing his right tibia and fibula, under the care of the FAI\'s orthopaedic surgeon, Professor John O\'Byrne and Mr Gary O\'Toole, consultant orthopaedic surgeon,\" said a Football Association of Ireland statement. Mr O\'Toole is well known in Irish sporting circles as a former Olympic swimmer. Coleman\'s serious leg break happened midway through the second half of the World Cup qualifier.\"He has had an exceptional season with both club and country, and he will be a big loss,\" added Republic boss O\'Neill.\"But Seamus is so mentally strong that when he has fully recovered he will be as brilliant as before.\" Wales manager Chris Coleman said defender Taylor was \"despondent\" following the game.\"First and foremost, the most important thing is Seamus Coleman,\" he said. \"We are told that it is not so good, which we are sorry for.\"Neil Taylor is not really that type of player, but it\'s a tough one for Seamus. Our thoughts are with him. I have not seen it again.\"Everton return to Premier League action with the Merseyside derby against Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday, 1 April. Everton midfielder James McCarthy was scheduled to start for the Republic, but was withdrawn from the team-sheet before kick-off because of a hamstring injury. McCarthy has been released from the Republic squad for Tuesday\'s friendly with Iceland along with John O\'Shea, Glenn Whelan and Jonathan Walters. O\'Shea needed stitches in a leg wound after being injured in a sliding challenge from Gareth Bale, which resulted in the Real Madrid star receiving a booking which will rule him out of Wales\' next qualifier in Serbia on 11 June. The draw in Dublin meant the Republic missed out on returning to the top of Group D, after Serbia beat Georgia earlier on Friday, with Wales four points behind in third. The Republic\'s next Group D qualifier is at home to Austria, also on 11 June.\'Get well soon, Seamus\' Devastated of what happened. Hope you have a speedy recovery my friend, best wishes for you. You will come back even stronger!!! SeamusColeman. Get well soon @seamiecoleman23!! #RightBackUnit Gutted for Seamus Coleman. Hopefully he\'ll have speedy recovery Stay strong Seamus Coleman.

'US ranchers saddle up for trade battle with Washington \"Tremendously important\" is how rancher Coleman Locke describes the role of international trade to his cattle business. The 72-year-old has worked on his family\'s 10, 000-acre ranch on the Gulf Coast of Texas for his whole life and has seen his fair share of struggles in the industry, including droughts and disease. But now he is gearing up for a new threat - the potential loss of trade deals that could cut off a huge slice of his ranch\'s yearly sales. \"In 2016, 25\% of the breeding stock that we sold here at this ranch went out of the United States, it\'s a tremendously important market for us,\" says Mr Locke. He\'s not alone. Last year the American beef industry earned over $6bn (£4. 9bn) from overseas sales. Among the biggest purchasers are Canada and Mexico, partners with the US in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). President Trump\'s promise to renegotiate Nafta and possibly place tariffs on Mexico or other US trading partners has the industry worried.\"Nafta is extremely important to us. It\'s one of the biggest trade deals that agriculture has ever had,\" says John Robinson from the National Cattlemen\'s Beef Association (NCBA). The beef industry is already reeling from the loss of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which . The free trade agreement with Pacific Rim countries, including many in Asia, was set to expand America\'s export market for beef. By some estimates, it could have added $400m in sales each year. \"It makes the market very nervous when they hear we aren\'t going to do the TPP and we are going to change Nafta,\" says Jennings Steen, a cattle dealer based in Austin. Mr Steen says he and his partner have been fielding dozens of calls since President Trump\'s election, from ranchers desperate to know how changes to trade deals could affect their businesses. They are concerned about prices and hesitate to make long-term plans. American suppliers particularly wanted increased access to Japan\'s home market, where high tariffs on US beef have made it hard to compete with suppliers from Australia who can sell beef into Japan at lower rates. But President Trump\'s supporters say his experience in business will allow him to negotiate better deals for the US, focussing on bilateral agreements rather than bigger deals involving several countries. Nafta changes According to Texas agriculture commissioner Sid Miller, after 22 years Nafta is in need of a \"facelift\". Mr Miller was an outspoken and early supporter of President Trump. But since the election, he has spent a lot of time reassuring the ranching community that trade with Mexico won\'t disappear and new trade options will be opened up under the Trump administration. Mr Miller says he takes \"a softer kinder approach [than Donald Trump],\" stressing that Texas needs trading partners like Mexico, but also that it needs new deals with countries like China and better deals with its existing partners. President Trump\'s vision for changes to Nafta has focused on ensuring more products are made in the US and he has called for tariffs on manufactured goods imported into the US from Mexico. But such tariffs could result in retaliatory charges on US products sold into Mexico - including agricultural goods like cattle and beef. Mr Miller is unshaken by this prospect, though. He acknowledges that US farmers produce more than the country can consume - including beef - but sees this as giving the US leverage over other trading partners. \"Agriculture is a good bargaining tool,\" he says. \"People have to eat, they don\'t have to buy manufactured goods.\" More than trade President Trump\'s relationship with the cattle industry though isn\'t as simple as a beef over trade. Rural communities voted overwhelmingly in support of Mr Trump. Beef and cattle producers, like other members of the agricultural industry, would like to see the rollbacks on regulations that President Trump has promised. \"I think cattle producers and rural America, in general, are optimistic about the Trump administration,\" says the NCBA\'s John Robinson. Within President Trump\'s first month, there were regulatory rollbacks that Mr Robinson calls \"very encouraging\". But he says he hopes the beef industry is given an equal seat to manufacturing when it comes to renegotiating Nafta. That seat is crucial because the US produces more beef than it consumes. Without international markets, suppliers will have to reduce production or see a significant drop in prices, as the market is flooded with local beef. There is no guarantee either that the bilateral deals President Trump has promised will be better than the ones he has walked away from. As a part of TPP, US beef producers who currently face import duties of up to 38. 5\% on fresh and frozen beef entering Japan would have seen those tariffs phased out over 16 years. Without that deal, many worry competition from countries that remained in TPP, like Australia, will increase. For Coleman Locke on his ranch in Texas, it\'s too soon to worry. No deals have been struck yet and business is still good. But if President Trump wants to claim his title as America\'s dealmaker in chief he\'s going to have to be sure he doesn\'t trade away this rancher\'s livelihood. ',business
'Fox and Sky: Is this time different? Culture Secretary Karen Bradley has said she is \"minded to\" refer the bid by 21st Century Fox for the 61\% of Sky it doesn\'t own to Ofcom, the regulator. I am minded to be wary of ministers who adopt strong stances on issues while deferring decisions to other people - but more of that later. For now, let\'s assume Mrs Bradley does indeed refer the bid. Various sources tell me the timing depends on how much parliamentary time is consumed by Article 50, but Mrs Bradley has until Friday, and could announce as early as Wednesday. : media plurality commitment to broadcasting standards This week, Ofcom said it would, if Mrs Bradley referred the decision, also conduct a \"fit and proper\" test on James Murdoch. In this blog, I will answer the following question: what\'s changed between the Murdoch family\'s last bid for full control of Sky, which had to be aborted, and this one? In other words, is this time different? For James Murdoch - who always saw Sky as unfinished business, and who has spent most of his career growing entertainment rather than news businesses - there are two pillars to the argument that this is not merely a re-run - put simply: \"The landscape has changed. We have changed.\" Let\'s take these in turn. It is undoubtedly true that news is undergoing a revolution. You\'d expect me to say that, given I owe my job to it, but it is true. According to Ofcom, social media is now the primary source of news for more than a third of British Millennials (those born between 1982 and 2004). Moreover, Ofcom says Facebook is the third biggest source of news, by number of references, for UK consumers, and as a result of this explosive growth in social media, a new generation is getting more news - albeit of variable veracity - from more places. The average Brit now gets their news from 3. 5 sources, compared with 2. 9 back in 2010. These are numbers used by 21st Century Fox to justify its claim that the news media is undergoing rapid transformation. No sober observer could argue that the habits of news consumers are the same now as they were six years ago. Political context When the Murdochs last bid for full control of Sky, it was their news division, News Corporation, that proposed the deal. In 2013, Rupert Murdoch split his company into entertainment and newspaper operations. This time, the bid is coming from 21st Century Fox - essentially the entertainment side of the company, rather than the news division. James Murdoch would argue that both 21st Century Fox and Sky are companies with independent boards, and that what this deal is really about is giving Fox better access to Sky\'s 22 million customers, who primarily consume entertainment rather than news. Seeing this as a bid by one entertainment company for another is what James Murdoch means by \"We have changed.\"Of course, the biggest change between now and the last bid is the political context. The Murdochs pulled out of their last attempt to take control of Sky because of public revulsion at the criminality within their British newspaper, and - crucially - the concerted effort of political opponents. Last time round, not only was there a more effective and co-ordinated Labour fight-back under Ed Miliband, who is strongly opposed to what he sees as vested interests in the media, but the Lib Dems were in government and counted enemies of Mr Murdoch among their most senior figures. It was Vince Cable, of course, who told undercover reporters he had \"declared war\" against Mr Murdoch. And, because former News of the World editor Andy Coulson worked for the prime minister, the bid became a prelude to a much bigger story about the relationship between the media, business, and politics. Now, Mr Cameron is gone, Coulson has been to jail, the Lib Dems are shrivelled and no longer in government, Labour is less vocal on this subject - and, above all, the phone-hacking scandal has receded from headlines (and cultural memory). Those, then, are the principal differences. How would opponents of this bid counter these points? First, they would argue that the division within the Murdoch stable is synthetic: this might be 21st Century Fox rather than News Corporation, but ultimately it\'s all the Murdoch family. Secondly, they would argue that we need to have the second instalment of the Leveson Inquiry, which looks at police corruption and corporate governance (not least by James Murdoch), before a fully informed decision can be made. Former Labour Prime Minister . Next, they would say that the shocking allegations about sexual harassment at Fox News, another Murdoch subsidiary, are another reason to query their corporate governance. In New York last week, several senior figures in the media industry told me they were interested in whether would have an impact on Murdoch\'s ambitions in the UK. And finally, these opponents would argue that for all the talk of new digital competitors and the rise of social media, the strength of Rupert Murdoch\'s newspapers here give him too much influence and control already, resulting in damage to our democracy. Influence and control To these counter-points 21st Century Fox would naturally say if you really want to know who has too much influence and control, take a look at the BBC, which is by a huge margin the most powerful voice in British media and culture. That is a familiar refrain: James Murdoch in particular has been . These, then, are some of the ways in which circumstances have changed since the last bid - or, as some would have it, stayed the same. In their remarkable history of financial crises, showed how, over centuries, investors and policymakers failed to learn the lessons of history, falsely thinking each big decision they made had no precedent. Ofcom\'s decision on this bid, if indeed the culture secretary refers it, will hinge on whether this time is different. Pipes with ideas Has a clearly diversifying media landscape evolved enough to overcome historical concerns about excessive influence and the character of those who most want this deal to happen? The latest bid, by the way, is wholly consistent with the trend across the media industry of consolidation - namely, the marriage of distribution and content, which I call pipes with ideas. New competition for eyeballs from digital giants such as Netflix and Amazon is making those people who own the content - the storytelling of drama, news, documentaries, comedy and family entertainment - to get together with those who own the means of reaching customers. In this instance, 21st Century Fox own the content, and they want full access to Sky\'s pipes. As for the culture secretary\'s intervention, I would be wary of reading too much into the fruity language of her letter saying she was \"minded to\" refer the bid to Ofcom - or indeed in the energetic rebuttal it received from 21st Century Fox. There is little political downside to making such a referral: it allows Mrs Bradley to issue bromides about media plurality, give the appearance of standing up to vested interests - and ultimately defer a decision to an independent regulator. Not that I have any reason to doubt her commitment to a raucous and successful media. But the bigger decision she has to personally make (in conjunction with Theresa May) is whether to go ahead with the second, promised stage of the Leveson Inquiry. This decision is just a warm-up. Several government sources have told me their personal view that this second stage is either rendered unnecessary by the criminal trials since the first inquiry - or that a judge-led inquiry involving high-profile testimony would be a terrible distraction at a time when the government is trying to manage Brexit, and needs newspapers on-side. When dealing with the Fox-Sky bid, Mrs Bradley knows her decision to refer (or not) won\'t be subject to the same scrutiny or political heat as her decision, made in conjunction with the prime minister, on Leveson Two.

'Brexit: UK has \'moral responsibility\' to Gibraltar, peers say The government has a \"moral responsibility\" to protect the interests of Gibraltar during Brexit negotiations, a Lords committee says. The EU committee said the single market and cross-border travel were vital to the territory\'s economy, and warned the UK government not to let Spain use trade talks to claim sovereignty. Gibraltar voted overwhelmingly for Remain in June\'s referendum. The government says it will ensure the territory\'s priorities are understood. Gibraltar has been a British territory since 1713, but Spain continues to claim sovereignty over the enclave, and the government in Madrid called for joint sovereignty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. \'Mutual importance\' The vote of 95. 9\% in favour of staying in the EU made Gibraltar by far the strongest pro-Remain area taking part in the referendum. Peers said 40\% of its workforce crossed the border from Spain every day, and its economy was \"underpinned\" by the single market. The committee said it \"strongly endorses\" the UK government\'s promise never to enter into sovereignty discussions with Spain against the will of the Gibraltarian people, and called on ministers to engage \"positively and pragmatically with Spain, emphasising the mutual importance of the economic relationship between the UK and Spain\". Prime Minister Theresa May has confirmed the UK will not remain a member of the EU single market after Brexit, instead seeking a new free trade deal. The peers said while it was unclear how withdrawal would affect the border, there were \"serious potential economic implications for both Gibraltar and the surrounding area of Spain\".\"Now set to leave the EU, the territory has placed its trust in the UK to secure a Brexit deal that meets Gibraltar\'s needs,\" they said.\"The committee stresses that the UK government has a moral responsibility to ensure Gibraltar\'s voice is heard, and its interests respected, throughout the negotiating process.\"\'Out the room\' The committee also said Gibraltar should be made a priority in talks over security co-operation so its border cannot be used by criminals. And it suggested existing rules governing the passport-free Schengen area could allow continued movement between Gibraltar and Spain. Formal Brexit talks are set to begin once Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty has been invoked by the UK government before the end of March. The committee added: \"The UK government must remain alert to and resist any attempts by Spain to involve the sovereignty dispute in EU withdrawal and future trade negotiations, or to encroach upon Gibraltar\'s sovereignty through the medium of EU laws or policies when the UK is \'out of the room\', after Brexit.\"In the official document setting out its Brexit strategy, the UK government said a new joint ministerial council with the government of Gibraltar would help ensure its views were heard.\"We will continue to involve them fully in our work, respect their interests and engage with them as we enter negotiations, and strengthen the bonds between us as we forge a new relationship with the EU and look outward into the world,\" its adds.',politics
'World wide web creator Tim Berners-Lee targets fake news The inventor of the world wide web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, has unveiled a plan to tackle data abuse and fake news. In an open letter to mark the web\'s 28th anniversary, Sir Tim has set out a five-year strategy amid concerns he has about how the web is being used. Sir Tim said he wants to start to combat the misuse of personal data, which creates a \"chilling effect on free speech\". He also called for tighter regulation of \"unethical\" political adverts. The British computer scientist said he wants the people who have helped develop the web with blogs, tweets, photos, videos and web pages to help come up with practical solutions to make a web \"that gives equal power and opportunity to all\". Users are often unable to tell outlets what data they would not like shared, Sir Tim said. Terms and conditions were \"all or nothing\". Sir Tim said he wants to work with companies to put \"a fair level of data control back in the hands of people\". He also expressed concerns that government surveillance is going too far and stopping the web from being used to explore topics such as sensitive health issues, sexuality or religion. Social media sites and search engines must be encouraged to continue efforts to combat the problem of fake news, Sir Tim said. However, central bodies deciding what is true or not should be avoided, he added. Certain algorithms can favour sensationalist information designed to surprise or shock users rather than reflect the truth and can \"spread like wildfire\", Sir Tim said. What is fake news? The arrival of social media - and the fight for clicks - has meant real and fictional stories are presented in such a similar way that it can be hard to tell the two apart. So-called \"fake news\" could be false information deliberately circulated by those who have scant regard for the truth but hope to advance particular (often extreme) political causes and make money out of online traffic. Or it could be false information circulated by journalists who don\'t realise it\'s false. Fake news has become so prevalent that the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee about the public being swayed by propaganda and untruths. The committee was spurred by claims that voters in the US election were influenced by fake news, it said. Pope Francis was reported to have backed Donald Trump\'s presidency campaign, for example, when he had not made an endorsement. Meanwhile, Mr Trump himself has used the term fake news to refer to critical stories about his administration, picking out organisations such as CNN and BBC. Sir Tim advocated transparency so users can understand how web pages appear on their devices and suggested a set of common principles for sites to follow. And he raised concerns about how online political advertising had become a \"sophisticated\" industry. Sir Tim said there were indications some targeted advertising was being used in \"unethical ways\" to keep voters away from the polls or directing people to fake news sites. He suggested companies could put subscription payments and small automated charges in place to make money without these types of adverts. However, despite highlighting issues on the world wide web which be believed need addressing, Sir Tim has admitted the solutions \"will not be simple\".',tech
'Claressa Shields: From poverty &amp; abuse to boxing greatness My childhood I was born in Flint, Michigan in 1995, but I didn\'t start talking until I was five. By then, my father had been in prison for three years for dealing drugs. I wouldn\'t meet him again for another four. I\'m not going to say my mum didn\'t care for us, but she left us to fend for ourselves. She abused alcohol and didn\'t know how to control it. There were times my little sister and I would walk around looking for mum for days on end. I\'d have to go out and get food and whatever food we got I would always give to my younger siblings. If there were two packs of ramen noodles, my little sister ate one, my little brother ate one and I didn\'t eat. We would sleep on the couch or the floor - and more than likely my sister or my brother was on the couch, so I would be on the floor. Growing up and going without instilled an independence in me. I learned if anyone\'s going to take care of you, it\'s going to be you. You don\'t get upset about things, you just get used to it. But you learn ways around it. You learn how to do little jobs for money - walking to the store for people and grabbing their groceries will get you about two dollars. It was at this time, though, that I was raped. It happened every day for about six months by a person known to the family. My aunt had never seen me cry. I was always a good, quiet child - but she saw fear in my eyes. I couldn\'t speak well as a child - I had a speech impediment - so when she asked me what had happened, I wasn\'t able to say it. She gave me a doll and I was able to show her everything he had done to me. I was kind of terrified of men for a while and my anger was really bad. I was really quiet, smart and very skinny, but I got bullied when I was seven or eight. People would copy my work and make fun of me all the time because of my stutter. One day I was at my desk and a girl walked past, said something and pulled my hair. I didn\'t do anything, just put my head down - but then this girl walked past and pulled my hair again. So I got up and I punched her. The feeling was one of relief. I was kicked out for a couple of days, but when I came back to school nobody messed with me. So from that day, anybody who messed with me, I fought them. Proving my dad wrong My dad had been out of prison a couple of years by then and getting to know him definitely helped me understand things about myself. I didn\'t know why I was easily angered before, but his temper is way worse than mine. In the same way, I didn\'t know why I laughed so loud, but he laughed just as hard as me. One day we were in the city and he was very stressed out. He had been in prison for so many years and was trying to change his life, but wasn\'t getting any jobs or opportunities.\"If I stuck to what I was passionate about, I wouldn\'t be in this situation,\" he said.\"What were you passionate about?\" I asked.\"Boxing,\" he replied. \"They used to call me cannonball because my fist was hard and I was fast as lightning.\"He said he thought some of my cousins would take up the sport, but none did. He mentioned that of Muhammad Ali\'s nine children only his daughter Leila Ali took up boxing - and when he said that I thought he was asking me to take after him, so I headed to the gym at Berston Field House in Flint. After about three days down there my coach Jason said my parents had to sign me up. My dad said: \"No! Boxing is a man\'s sport and you\'re too pretty to box.\"\"What the hell are you talking about?\" I said. \"I\'m not going to be a model. I\'m not going to be a singer. I\'m going to be some type of athlete - and I want to be a boxer.\"A few days later, I went to his house and it was like an intervention. Him, his wife and her three kids were sitting at this table in the dining room and they all voted on if I should box or not. Everybody else said yeah, he said no. That was my first victory. I beat my dad, majority decision. He said that once he signed me up and paid my $60 membership, I couldn\'t quit boxing for a year. My dad will tell you today that was the best $60 he ever spent. Olympic glory Six years later, I was going to London 2012. I was a 25-1 shot and they are not good odds. I heard some commentators say that, at 17, I would be lucky to get a bronze medal. I watched the Russian Nadezda Torlopova win her semi-final and thought there is no way she can beat me. They always say the Russians are strong, though, and I felt like the female Rocky. When the announcer said \"the winner, from the United States\" I just remember being calm. I felt vindicated. I had told people and I had shown people. I held in how much I wanted to celebrate 2012 for four years. I didn\'t go to the club or celebrate with friends. I was back in the gym three months later. Before Rio 2016, I kept hearing that no American boxer had ever defended an Olympic title. Not Joe Frazier, not George Foreman not Pernell Whitaker, not Oscar de la Hoya, not Leon Spinks - but I would say: \"Well, I ain\'t them.\"Reporters would comment on how confident I was, but if you believe in yourself and work hard, how can you not be confident? I worked harder than anyone around me, and I worked alone a lot. I didn\'t care about accolades or people saying you\'re working really hard. I did it for myself. I knew I had checked my boxes. All of them. I knew I had it in the bag, it was just about going out there and doing it, those last little 10 steps. I made the final fight look so easy. I was so calm and so dominant all fight. When they announced the result, I grabbed the flag and just ran around screaming. My mind kind of left my body. After all the things I had been through in my life, I just looked out on where I was. I was able to make it. It didn\'t stop me. A reminder of the past The last time I saw the man who raped me was when I was 16. He was walking his dog. He looked at me and I looked at him. Thank God he did have the dog. If he didn\'t I would have beaten him up and would have probably been in jail before I got a chance to go to the Olympics. But you can\'t let something someone did to you - something that made you feel so worthless - stop your life. I\'m not going to let a man that evil and foul have control over me. I\'m not going to let him be the decision-maker. I could have made bad choices in life, but I was still in school, still boxing and still winning. It didn\'t stop me from being great. ',sport
'What really makes Bear Grylls afraid? Bear Grylls might be confident about climbing mountains, wrestling alligators and challenging the wilderness to do its venomous worst - but there\'s one thing that fills him with horror. Cocktail parties full of strangers.\"We all have fears. People say, \'You can\'t have any fears\', but I\'m scared of so many things,\" says the man who has what must be the best ever job description, of \"adventurer\".\"I\'m really bad at cocktail parties with lots of people I don\'t know. I really genuinely am.\"Maggots and steep rock faces are less daunting to him than unarmed combat with canapes and small talk. Speaking at an international education conference, Grylls says he lacked confidence as a youngster and describes his own approach to tackling fear and those nagging self-doubts.\"I\'ve learned that the best way over our fears is right bang through the middle. It really is. The only way you don\'t see the fear is when you\'re right on it.\"I\'ve learned this the hard way. It\'s how I deal with it now,\" he said at the Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai. He says he is also \"really nervous\" of jumping out of aeroplanes, which is understandable since in his 20s he broke his back in three places in a parachuting accident in Africa. His recovery from this injury became the springboard for his later ambitions - setting the target of climbing Everest and giving him the fire in his belly to make the most of this \"second chance\" in life.\"It was definitely a dark time after that accident.\"My over-riding emotion was that I really have got lucky. I should either be dead or paralysed. There\'s got to be some purpose behind this. Life has given me a second chance.\"I might be a bit crook and a bit scarred, but I\'m OK and I\'m really going to claw my way back - and I really want to do something with my life. \"Sometimes in life it takes a knock to remember what we really value.\" There probably isn\'t a pamphlet in the careers office for people wanting to become adventurers. But Grylls has a straightforward explanation for the path he took - and the occupational hazard of constantly putting himself in danger.\"It\'s the only thing I\'m good at. I\'m not saying that out of modesty, it really is. It\'s my job, it\'s what I really love. It\'s what over the years I\'ve become half-decent at.\"And he says the parachute accident was another spur to improve and get things right in split-second decisions. When his parachute was failing to function properly and he was spinning to the ground, he says he wasn\'t thinking about his life flashing before his eyes - instead he was trying to sort out the parachute. More stories from the looking at education from an international perspective, and . You can join the debate at the . But he \"ran out of time and hit the ground very hard\" and says that, in retrospect, he should have used those seconds to use the reserve chute.\"I made a promise to myself on that hospital bed that I was going to become the fastest-thinking, the quickest-reaction dude out there. Now I really take pride that I\'m good in those moments. But these are skills we develop.\" He is famous for his survival skills. But he says the first inhospitable terrain he had to conquer was his own lack of self-confidence.\"I wasn\'t very good at school - and I struggled a lot with confidence,\" says the Eton-educated adventurer. But he says such early struggles can be better preparation than success coming too easily.\"The great people I know in life often struggled at school, because it was the struggle that developed their strength.\"His descriptions are also punctuated by an awareness of the small margins between success and failure - and life and death. When he talks about the last exhausting phase of climbing Everest, he describes coming across the body of another climber he had known, Rob Hall, who had died on the mountain two years before.\"I remember just sitting next to Rob, still perfectly there, his hair blowing, as if I could nudge him and he\'d stand up and be fine. \"I desperately needed something to give me strength - and he is such a hero of mine. I just remember this panic filling me - there are a lot of bodies on the mountain, but this was different - we were so close, but now so far away.\"He pushed on and became one of the youngest climbers to get to the summit of Everest. And he says he brought back some snow from the summit and kept it as a liquid symbol of conquering his self-doubt. Grylls\'s popularity as a TV presenter has been based on his Boy\'s Own adventures in the world\'s wild places. It\'s in contrast to the worries about young people spending too long in front of screens, missing out on exercise and stressing over social media. He says young people need to see the outdoor world and to experience risk in their lives to build a spirit of adventure and curiosity.\"If you strip risk out of young people\'s lives, you kill that spirit. Risk is all around us - and you empower kids if you teach them how to manage that risk.\"And he says it\'s the shy and under-confident youngsters he wants to encourage most.\"The rewards in life don\'t always go to the biggest or the bravest, the cleverest, or even the best,\" he tells them. \"The rewards in life go to the dogged and the determined, to the tenacious, those who get back on their feet when they get kicked.\"He\'s prepared for numbingly cold temperatures and the threats of hungry predators.

'Steps are coming back with an Abba song They started off as a novelty act, designed to cash in on the 1990s line-dancing craze - but Steps\' popularity has been surprisingly long-lived. Often derided as a \"bargain basement Abba\", they sold more than 15 million albums before their split in 2001. After reforming in 2012, they\'ve finally made a new album - which happens to include a song by Abba\'s Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson. Called , it\'s a cover of a song by Andersson\'s current band. Written in the vein of The Winner Takes it All, it\'s a typically Abba-esque ballad about a woman whose life is turned upside down when she sees an old lover\'s face in a crowd. \"The song\'s got a good story,\" Steps\' singer . \"We felt it was a good nod to where we\'ve been musically as a band, but I related to the words while I was recording it.\" It\'s certainly a cunning choice - acknowledging the band\'s debt to Abba, without desecrating one of their classics. According to singer Claire Richards, it has even had the seal of approval from Abba themselves.\"Benny really liked our take on it,\" . \"He said it\'s almost as good as his version!\"Story of a Heart will feature on Tears on the Dancefloor, Steps\' first album of new songs since Buzz, released 17 years ago. It will be preceded by a single, Scared of the Dark, which is out this Friday; and the band will embark on a 15-date tour this November. Scott-Lee said the world was ready for another dose of Steps\' bright-eyed chart pop.\"What we can offer is escapism and a bit of positivity in people\'s lives,\" she said. \"Everyone\'s dealing with lots of different things but music\'s universal, and it takes you to another place and time, and this album - I feel - is where Steps should be 20 years on.\" Potted history of Steps The band were formed in 1997, after an advert appeared in The Stage announcing open auditions for a five-piece line-dancing pop group. The successful applicants were Lisa Scott-Lee, Ian \"H\" Watkins, Derek O\'Brien, Maddy Chan, and Mitch Stevens. After the initial line-up failed to gel, further auditions were held; with Lisa and H joined by Claire Richards, Faye Tozer and Lee Latchford Evans Their debut single, was a cheesy dance track that capitalised on the line-dancing craze. It failed to make the top 10, but hung around the charts for months, eventually becoming one of the biggest-selling singles of the decade. Steps then signed to Jive Records, attracting the attention of pop svengali Pete Waterman, who plotted to make the five-piece \"Abba on speed\". Waterman provided their second single - a Bananarama cast-off called - which went into the UK top 10. Their third single, , started a run of 14 consecutive top 10 hits, including and . Each of their songs had its own dance routine, printed on the inner sleeve of the CD single. - a cover of the Bee Gees classic - was their big cultural moment, reaching number one in 1999. H befriended Britney Spears, leading to Steps supporting the star on her 1999 US tour. An hour before the last date of their Gold tour in 2001, H and Claire handed their bandmates letters announcing they were quitting. H and Claire launched a solo career, which flopped after one album, and briefly hosted Saturday morning kids\' show SM: TV. And that was the end... until the band were coaxed together for a Sky Living documentary in 2011. \"Did you really hate us?\" Faye asked H and Claire. Lisa said she would \"never get over\" the way the band ended. But she did, and they toured the next year, selling out arenas across the country. They subsequently released an album of covers, but took time off to pursue solo projects in 2013. H appeared in Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat while Faye starred in a touring production of Singin\' in the Rain. Behind the scenes, they appointed new managers and began work on comeback album Tears on the Dancefloor. ',entertainment
'Bertie Ahern warns of danger of \'hard\' NI border The former Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern has warned dissident Republicans could use a re-introduction of border posts in Northern Ireland to justify their campaign of violence. He said a hard border, with customs checks, will have to be re-introduced because of the UK\'s decision to leave most of the customs union under Brexit. Mr Ahern drew a comparison with the IRA\'s Border Campaign in the 1950s. But he said he did not expect a return to large-scale violence. Mr Ahern was speaking to BBC Newsnight ahead of elections to Northern Ireland\'s Assembly on Thursday. The elections were triggered after Sinn Féin, which has shared power with the Democratic Unionist Party for 10 years, withdrew its support from the executive, in a row over . But there has also been a loss of trust between between Sinn Féin and the DUP over issues such as the legacy of the Troubles and the impact of the Brexit vote. The UK government has pledged to ensure there will be of the past between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But Mr Ahern told Newsnight that the UK\'s decision to sever its links with most of the EU\'s customs union means that a hard border, with customs checks, will have to be re-introduced.\"Nobody envisaged that this would end up where it is. And a year ago, I would not say there was a voter that was on the outside that thought of a customs union on the border,\" he said. \"I tried to warn of that, but people didn\'t want to listen to it - including the Conservative politicians who should have.\" The former prime minister said that the re-introduction of border posts could be used by dissident Irish republicans to justify their existing campaign of violence.\"The 1956-62 border campaign was targeted in a very clear way against checks on the border. There were mainly southern IRA activists who attacked the posts on the border. \"There is no doubt about it. Those people - small as they are - are always dangerous because anyone who plays the game of armed struggle or violence is always the danger.\"They would see checks on the border, and customs officers on the border, and the identification of the border, as in some way justifying the kind of things that they always have in their mind.\"The IRA\'s border campaign, which took place a decade before the start of the modern day Troubles in 1969, involved deadly attacks. But it was on a much smaller scale than the violence that erupted in the late 1960s, prompting the deployment of the British army onto the streets of Northern Ireland. Mr Ahern\'s warnings were echoed in stronger terms by Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair\'s former chief of staff, who was intimately involved in the Northern Ireland peace process during the former prime minister\'s 10 years in office. \"I believe it will be very dangerous if you start having to have a hard border again,\" he said. \"If you put in blocks along the border, people are going to be trying to destroy those, and that will create problems. \"If you set up border checks - even if those border checks are 10 miles one side or the other of the border - you\'re setting people up in static positions. That makes it incredibly easy to shoot at them. And as soon as they come out of those checks, they will be easy to shoot at. \"Now the dissidents are tiny, the dissidents are not really a threat - they\'re not in any way comparable to the old IRA. \"But it takes very few people to start murdering officers in those circumstances, and once they start murdering them, it\'s very hard to know how to react.\"But Lord Bew, who advised the former Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, said that a deal may be reached which will ensure that today\'s so-called \"soft border\" can be maintained.\"At this moment there\'s a fear north of the border among the nationalist and Catholic community that you\'re going to move back towards at least a more visible border, and more irritating checks, and people have become so used to the border being an almost non-existent fact, that this is very irritating. \"It may well be that three years from now we will see that these fears were exaggerated but that\'s why it\'s so significant and dangerous that were having this election now.\" James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary is likely to convene talks between the main parties to try to re-establish the power-sharing executive after the election. These are likely to continue during the traditional St Patrick\'s Day celebrations in the White House on 17 March. George Mitchell, the former US senator who chaired the Good Friday Agreement negotiations, told Newsnight that Donald Trump should use that occasion to engage in Northern Ireland.\"I hope very much that the president... will focus on the issue and will reassure the guests from both the Republic and Northern Ireland, and other places, that the United States policy of support for the continuing process in Northern Ireland continues - and that we will do whatever we can, recognising the limited nature of our role, to keep that process moving forward.\" ',politics
'Norway news site checks you read story before commenting I have a love/hate relationship with the comments section on this blog. On the one hand, I like opening things up to discussions, scrutiny, praise and, yes, criticism. But on the other, it often descends into a tedious mess in which people question why I have a job, whether I\'m being \"paid off\" by Apple, how \"sad\" people who use Facebook are, and, naturally, the pros and cons of Brexit. I\'ve laughed with colleagues about how one day I\'ll write a story about how Elon Musk has invented a teleport to the moon… and the first comment will be: \"Really, BBC? Is this news?\"Joking aside, there\'s a reason why many news sites have abandoned comments sections altogether, and it\'s often because they provide little of merit. That\'s not to say readers don\'t have thoughtful views on the stories covered, but more that commenters aren\'t actually readers at all. Quite often it\'s glaringly obvious that comments have been written without the story being read, even just in part. So imagine my delight today when, , I read about Norwegian broadcaster NRK.

'Toyota to invest £240m in UK plant at Burnaston Toyota is to invest £240m in upgrading its UK factory that makes the Auris and Avensis models. The Japanese carmaker\'s near Derby will allow production of vehicles using its new global manufacturing system. The factory employs about 2, 500 people, while another 590 work at Toyota\'s engine plant at Deeside, North Wales. Burnaston made about 180, 000 vehicles last year, most of which are exported to Europe and other markets. Johan van Zyl, chief executive of Toyota Motor Europe, said the investment showed that the company was doing all it could to make Burnaston more competitive. However, he warned: \"Continued tariff-and-barrier free market access between the UK and Europe that is predictable and uncomplicated will be vital for future success.\" Industry trade body the SMMT said in January that uncertainty around Brexit and the UK\'s future trading arrangements had hit investment in the car sector. Investment commitments in the UK automotive sector last year totalled £1. 66bn, down from £2. 5bn in 2015. Business Secretary Greg Clark said Toyota\'s investment \"underlines the company\'s faith in its employees and will help ensure the plant is well positioned for future Toyota models to be made in the UK\". The government is providing £21. 3m in funding for training, research and development, and improving the Burnaston plant\'s environmental performance. Last year, rival carmaker Nissan said it would build both the new Qashqai and the X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland plant following government \"support and assurances\". Analysis John Moylan, industry correspondent The decision to upgrade the plant to take Toyota\'s New Global Architecture, its new system for producing vehicles worldwide, suggests the company sees the UK as part of its long-term future. But the UK\'s automotive industry knows that Brexit is coming and with it the possibility of tariffs and complex customs arrangements. That threatens the competitiveness of carmakers that rely upon the kind of just-in-time manufacturing which Toyota pioneered. Profit fall The general secretary of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said Toyota workers \"need to know that the government has their back and will do whatever is necessary to ensure new models and new investment keeps coming to Britain\".\"With discussions set to start on the replacement of models such as Vauxhall\'s Astra and decisions due on BMW\'s electric Mini, it is vital that ministers calm nerves by stating they will secure tariff-free access to the European single market and customs union in Brexit negotiations.\"In January, Toyota announced it was planning to spend over the next five years. The firm lost its crown as the world\'s biggest carmaker to Volkswagen last year. Last month, it expected to report net profits of 1. 7 trillion yen ($15. 1bn; £12. 1bn) for the 2016-17 financial year. However, that was lower than the 2. 1 trillion yen profit it recorded a year earlier.',business
'Obituary: Chuck Berry Chuck Berry\'s trademark four-bar guitar introduction and quickfire lyrics reflected the rebelliousness of the youth of the 1950s. He was one of that exclusive group who took rhythm and blues from its black roots and \"crossed over\" to make it part of most teenagers\' lifestyle. He influenced generations of succeeding rock stars, most notably the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys. Yet he faced major financial difficulties through mismanagement and had frequent brushes with the law. Charles Edward Anderson Berry was born into a middle-class family in St Louis, Missouri, on 18 October 1926. As a teenager he began playing concerts in his local high school but his education was curtailed after he was convicted of armed robbery and spent three years in a reformatory for young offenders. On his release he made a living as a hairdresser, playing in a trio in the evenings with Ebby Harding on drums and Johnnie Johnson on piano. Johnson would remain with Berry throughout his careerHe was influenced by blues heroes such as Muddy Waters and T-Bone Walker, as well as white country and western music, though his singing style owed much to the clarity of Nat King Cole.\"My music is simple stuff,\" he once said. \"Anyone can sit down, look at a set of symbols and produce sounds the music represents.\"Charged His recording career began in 1955 with the legendary Chess label in Chicago, where his first release Maybellene became one of rock and roll\'s first hits. In the next few years, he scored a succession of hits, all aimed at an adolescent audience, including Roll Over Beethoven, Sweet Little Sixteen, Carol and the classic Johnny B. Goode. His music transcended the colour bar that plagued many contemporary black artists as affluent white teenagers in Eisenhower\'s America reached out for something new.\"I play the songs they want to hear,\" he said. \"That makes them feel they\'re getting what they came for.\" He appeared in several rock films including Rock, Rock, Rock and Mr Rock and Roll, both from 1957; Go Johnny Go from 1959; and Jazz on a Summer\'s Day in 1960. In 1962 he was charged with transporting a minor across state lines for immoral purposes. The girl in question was a 14-year-old from Texas who he claimed he had brought to Missouri to check hats at his St Louis nightclub. After he fired her, she complained to the police. In court, the judge\'s summing-up was blatantly racist and the trial was eventually declared null and void. Double entendres His conviction at a second trial and the resulting two-year sentence left him embittered. His release coincided with the rhythm and blues revival in Britain. With his material being covered by bands like The Beatles and the Rolling Stones, his work was discovered by a new generation.\"If you tried to give rock and roll another name,\" John Lennon famously said, \"you might call it Chuck Berry.\" Successful tours followed. He scored a few more hits with No Particular Place to Go and Memphis, Tennessee. His biggest hit came later in Britain with the atypical 1972 novelty record, My Ding-a-Ling, replete with double entendres. When he wasn\'t churning out the hits, Chuck Berry was thrilling audiences with his live performances. His trademark became his duck walk, a crouching movement across the stage made during his guitar solos. Offstage, he could be a prickly character, exemplified in the 1987 film Hail! Hail! Rock \'n\' Roll which featured a tour with a backing band organised by devotee Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones. In the same year, he published an explicit autobiography genuinely penned by himself. Jail sentence Berry\'s attitude to money was notorious. He demanded cash upfront for many of his concerts and in 1979, he served a 100-day jail term for tax evasion. There were further brushes with the law. In 1988 he settled a lawsuit from a woman he allegedly punched in the face. Two years later he was sued by a group of women after it was discovered that a hidden camera had been placed in the toilets of his restaurant in Missouri. He also received a suspended jail sentence for marijuana possession. Despite the advancing years, he continued playing one-night concerts and embarked on a European tour in 2008 at the age of 82. In January 1986, Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with a citation that summed up his contribution to popular music.\"While no individual can be said to have invented rock and roll, Chuck Berry comes the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together.\"Berry himself had a simple explanation for his success.\"It amazes me when I hear people say, \'I want to go out and find out who I am.\' I always knew who I was. I was going to be famous if it killed me.\"',entertainment
'Labour: Tom Watson attacks Momentum-Unite \'secret plan\' Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for his MPs to unite - after his deputy Tom Watson warned of threats to the party from left-wing activists. Mr Watson was \"cheered to the rafters\" as he arrived at a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting which was described by BBC sources as \"explosive\". He claims the grassroots Momentum group is trying to increase its influence by obtaining funding from the Unite union. Unite, which is Labour\'s largest financial backer, has denied this. The row follows comments made by Momentum\'s Jon Lansman, who was reportedly taped saying Unite could affiliate to his group rather than just to Labour. \'So-called leader\' Mr Watson warned that Labour risks being destroyed by what he calls a \"secret plot\" by left-wing supporters of Mr Corbyn who are seeking to take control of the party. During the PLP meeting there was shouting over the leadership\'s handling of the issue, with one Labour MP referring to Mr Corbyn as a \"so-called leader\". Senior figures in the party challenged claims that Mr Watson had been isolated and condemned at an earlier meeting of the shadow cabinet. An aide to the Labour leader denied briefing against Mr Watson and said Mr Corbyn\'s message had been on the need for the party to talk about the issues which affect Labour voters - not internal issues within the Labour party. It is understood the chairman of the PLP warned that Momentum was operating as a \"party within a party\" after hearing a tape of Momentum founder Jon Lansman reportedly urging supporters to change the nature of the Labour party. One senior peer who is a veteran of earlier internal battles said it was \"like 1985 all over again\", while another senior peer said it was \"much worse than that\". The BBC\'s assistant political editor Norman Smith said the renewed infighting was potentially \"catastrophic\" for Labour coming in the wake of the Copeland by-election loss. Mr Watson said he had a duty to \"call out\" what appeared to be a \"secret plan\" to take over the Labour Party and he urged Len McCluskey to publicly state Unite would not fund Momentum if he was re-elected as Unite leader. In the recordings, which were revealed by The Observer newspaper, Mr Lansman says: \"Assuming that Len McCluskey wins the general secretaryship, which I think he will, Unite will affiliate to Momentum and will fully participate in Momentum, as will the CWU.\"He went on to tell activists it was \"absolutely crucial\" that they secured a change to the party\'s rules to ensure that whenever Mr Corbyn stands down, they are able to get a candidate on to the ballot paper to succeed him. Mr Watson told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme \"we have never seen the biggest union organising a political faction in the Labour Party with the tacit approval of the leadership\".\"Enough is enough, this has got to stop... I\'m afraid there are some people who do not have our electoral interests at heart\". Following what was described as a \"robust\" shadow cabinet meeting, Mr Watson and Mr Corbyn issued a joint statement saying they \"recognised the right of groups across the spectrum of Labour\'s broad church to discuss their views and try to influence the party so long as they operate within the rules\".\"No one speaks for the leadership except the leadership themselves and their spokespeople,\" they added. Ahead of Monday\'s meeting, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Watson\'s comments were \"disappointing\" and suggested he was trying to influence the outcome of the contest for Unite leader - in which incumbent Mr McCluskey - a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn - is being challenged by Gerard Coyne. The ballot papers for the contest will be sent out later this week, with the result to be announced next month. Mr McDonnell dismissed talk of any kind of plot to take control of the party, insisting \"this is not civil war\". \"It is all about Tom and the internal battle that he is trying to wage within Unite,\" he said. \'Democratic deficit\' Currently, a candidate must obtain the support of 15\% of Labour MPs and MEPs in order to stand - a threshold a new left-wing contender is unlikely to be able to meet. Christine Shawcroft, a member of Momentum who sits on the party\'s National Executive Council, said Labour\'s MPs could not have a \"veto\" on the wishes of the membership when the time came to electing Mr Corbyn\'s successor.\"We have a mass membership now and it wants its voice to be heard,\" she told Today. \"There is a democratic deficit in the Labour Party where the structures we have do not reflect the support for Jeremy Corbyn that has been shown by the mass of the members\". Tom Watson did not mince his words when he spoke to me on Monday morning. But was he really more concerned about the future of his party - or the future of his union, the now-inappropriately named Unite? Both are, in fact, currently inextricably linked. Mr Watson had been personally close to the union\'s general secretary Len McCluskey - they are former flatmates. But relations deteriorated when Labour\'s deputy leader failed to convince Mr McCluskey to persuade Jeremy Corbyn to agree a date when he would stand down as party leader last summer, after eight out of 10 of his MPs declared no confidence in him. So there is now political and personal animosity. Mr Watson, she suggested, was \"rather right-wing\" and wanted to return to a \"command and control\" system for running the party based on a \"Blairite model\". She rejected suggestions Momentum was a hard-left entryist organisation trying to infiltrate Labour, describing the terms as \"silly labels\".\"Jon said nothing that was at all controversial, but I think this is a concerted attempt to interfere in the internal election in Unite for general secretary, which is really shocking.\"She added: \"The offer is always open for any organisation, any trade union, to affiliate (to Momentum). They are welcome to do so. It is not a question of disaffiliating from the Labour Party and affiliating to Momentum instead.\" Momentum sources pointed out that the TSSA union is already affiliated to Momentum, adding that there have been no \"significant conversations\" with Unite about future funding. \'Entirely inaccurate\' The contest between Mr McCluskey and Mr Coyne, Unite\'s West Midlands organiser who has said the union needs to meddle less in internal Labour politics, is being seen as a proxy battle for control of the Labour movement. Most Unite branches have backed Mr McCluskey in his bid to be re-elected. Unite said Mr Watson\'s comments were \"entirely inaccurate\" and accused him of trying to \"interfere\" in the election.\"As Unite has made it clear it is exclusively for our executive council to determine which organisations we affiliate to,\" said acting general secretary Gail Cartmail. \"There are no plans for Unite to affiliate to Momentum.\"She added: \"Mr Watson is a Unite member with a right to a vote and a view. But he should remember that, first, he is deputy leader of the Labour party with the obligations that this senior post imposes, and second that Unite is not a subsidiary of any political organisation.\"But Mr Coyne countered: \"To say there are no plans over the next month is somewhat disingenuous in reality because it clearly is John Lansman\'s belief that Len McCluskey will support Momentum.\"',politics
'Apple wins iPhone 6 patent battle in China A ban that threatened to stop the sale of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus phones in China has been overturned after a court ruled in favour of Apple in a patent dispute. Chinese firm Baili sought a ban last year saying the iPhone infringed on the design of its 100C smartphone. China\'s patent regulator agreed with Baili and imposed the ban on Apple and local reseller Zoomflight. The Chinese court that overturned the ban said the regulator did not follow proper procedure when it was imposed. Application denied Sales of the Apple phones were allowed to continue while the court case and appeal were being heard. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court said the patent body had not given enough evidence to prove that a patented design was being violated. The court said the iPhone 6 models did not infringe on the design and patents owned by Baili as people could easily distinguish between the 100c and the Apple models. It did deny Apple\'s application to have Baili stripped of the patent at the centre of the case. Sales of Apple phones in China have come under pressure recently thanks to strong local competition from Huawei, Xiaomi and newer firms such as Oppo and Vivo. Last year, Apple sales in Greater China, which covers China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, were down 33\%. Beijing\'s Intellectual Property Office and Baili said they were considering whether to appeal against the court\'s decision. ',tech
'Cheltenham 2017: Lizzie Kelly prepares to make Gold Cup history If the Cheltenham Festival is \'the Olympics of horse racing\', then the Gold Cup is the equivalent of the 100m finals. It is the blue-riband race of the most prestigious meeting in the sport - but only once has a female jockey ridden in it, and that was more than a generation ago. Back in 1984, Linda Sheedy did not reach the finish on board 500-1 outsider Foxbury, so Devon-based Lizzie Kelly is determined to smash through another glass ceiling. Not that she goes along with the idea that women have it tougher in the saddle than their male counterparts.\"A lot of the time I don\'t think girls push themselves to the extent that I was willing to push myself,\" she told \"I wanted to dress like a male jockey, with all the right gear and everything, and you\'ve got to really strive to achieve just as much as they are.\"I had to do more to fit in, and look right, look the same as all the lads.\"\'I\'ve never seen another girl ride in it\' The 23-year-old rides Tea For Two in the big race on Friday and while she is comfortable with being viewed as a trailblazer in sport, it certainly is not something the burdens herself with.\"If anything I do is good for women in racing or women in sport, I always think that\'s a good thing, but it\'s a total by-product,\" added Kelly, who has been part of BBC Radio 5 live\'s commentary team at the festival.\"I\'m selfish, I\'m doing it for me, I\'m not doing it for females in general - I\'m doing it because this is what I\'ve worked towards and dreamed about since I was a kid.\"It\'s great if people look at me and think \'I can do better than her\' - go on then, come on, let\'s do it, because why not?\" Such a comment is typical of Kelly\'s go-getter personality - and she has already made racing history, by guiding Tea for Two to victory in the Kauto Star Novice Chase at Kempton in December 2015 to become the first female jockey to in Britain. \"When I left university I just thought, I don\'t want to sit in an office from now until retirement,\" she said.\"I was 21, and I just felt that I could sit in an office for 20 years in 20 years time, and that was the push.\"I thought you have to take your chances while they\'re still there, and I\'d have regretted not giving it a go in later life if I hadn\'t.\"Riding before reading Aside from the overriding gender theme, which Kelly accepts as a big talking point ahead of race day, it is a family team that surrounds Tea For Two. The eight-year-old is trained by her stepfather Nick Williams in the village of George Nympton, near Barnstaple, and co-owned by mother Jane Williams, who says her daughter wasted no time getting into the saddle.\"She was so young that she was riding in the arena, they had letters on each corner of the arena, and she didn\'t actually know what the letters were, she was that young she couldn\'t read,\" said Jane.\"She hasn\'t been given anything - she rides for us and we run a business, and if we don\'t get the success then we won\'t be here in years to come.\"It\'s not a gift, she\'s earned it and I feel very proud that somebody can be that dedicated that they actually make it work.\"Described as being \"a jockey for the big occasion\" by her step-dad, Jane says she is more worried about her horse\'s mentality on the day than that of her jockey.\"The horse is exceptionally temperamental - he likes going to Exeter, but I\'m not sure he particularly likes going to Cheltenham,\" she added.\"We\'ve got to get there - it is a concern because he will have a lot of stage fright that day I suspect, because the festival is completely different to any other race meeting.\"What are Lizzie\'s chances? Though Kelly and her family are proud to be making history at Cheltenham, they are looking to do far more than just make up the numbers. Tea For Two is a 66-1 chance with most bookmakers - but Jane Williams is surprised that the odds are so long and is targeting a place.\"First of all we\'ve got to get round, just jump round - if I came fifth or sixth I\'d be absolutely over the moon.\"The final word goes to Lizzie herself; how will she feel waking up on Friday morning?\"You think I\'m going to sleep?\" she responds. \"It\'s our first Gold Cup, it\'s his [Tea For Two\'s] first Gold Cup, my first Gold Cup, mum\'s first Gold Cup - so I think the only way I can try to feel is excited.\"',sport
'Ofcom plans instant payback for broadband woes Landline and broadband customers who suffer poor service could get money back automatically under plans set out by the telecoms regulator, Ofcom. Under the proposals, they would no longer have to \"fight tooth and nail\" to get \"fair compensation\", Ofcom said. The plan, which is now subject to consultation, could benefit up to 2. 6 million customers, the regulator added. The payments would apply whenever services go wrong and are not fixed quickly enough. Slow repairs, missed deadlines and engineers\' visits that fail to happen as promised would all be covered. up to £185m could be paid out as a result. Cash or credit \"Customers would be entitled to automatic compensation, without having to go through a potentially lengthy and difficult claims process,\" the regulator said. They would receive either a cash payment or a credit on their bill, with the level of payments set by Ofcom. The proposed scale of charges would be: £10 for each calendar day that the service is not repaired £30 for any time that an engineer fails to turn up for a scheduled appointment, or that it is cancelled with less than 24 hours\' notice £6 for each calendar day of delay at the start of a new service, including the missed start date. \"When a customer\'s landline or broadband goes wrong, that is frustrating enough, without having to fight tooth and nail to get fair compensation from the provider,\" said Ofcom\'s consumer group director, Lindsey Fussell. She said the proposals \"would mean customers are properly compensated, while providers will want to work harder to improve their service\". Ofcom said its consultation period on the proposals would last until 5 June. It will then publish its decision \"around the end of the year\". In response to the plan, BT, Sky and Virgin Media have issued their own draft proposal for automatic compensation through a voluntary code of practice. However, Ofcom said: \"At this stage, we do not consider that this proposal sufficiently meets our concerns.\"Ofcom said that each year, there were 7. 2 million instances that would be subject to compensation under its new proposals, but that currently, only 1. 1 million of these attracted payments. In response to the Ofcom proposals, a Virgin Media spokesperson said: \"It\'s important that customers are treated fairly when services can\'t be delivered, but this is best achieved through a robust industry-led approach. \"The industry is working together on ambitious reforms that would incentivise communications providers to compete to provide customers with a better service, while also setting minimum standards that providers would have to meet.\"Another broadband provider, TalkTalk, said: \"We welcome measures to make it easier for consumers to be reimbursed when things go wrong. \"In principle, we\'re broadly supportive of Ofcom\'s measures, but it\'s important that any scheme is fair and transparent and based on a set of minimum standards that guarantees every line is capable of providing the broadband customers depend on.\"\'Better deal\' Ofcom\'s proposals were welcomed by the Minister of State for Digital and Culture, Matt Hancock.\"Too many people are suffering from poor customer service when things go wrong with their broadband and phone lines,\" he said. \"So getting a better deal for consumers is at the heart of our Digital Economy Bill, which strengthens Ofcom\'s power to make sure providers pay compensation when service falls short. \"These changes will help make sure people are not cut off from friends, family and work for days on end, and are properly compensated if problems aren\'t fixed quickly enough.\"Alex Neill, of consumer group Which?, said: \"Broadband has become a modern day essential, so it is only right that consumers should get compensation when their provider fails to deliver.\"Ofcom now needs to swiftly push ahead with these proposals and ensure that this and other measures help to significantly improve the service that broadband customers receive,\" he said.',business

'Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon meet ahead of Article 50 The prime minister has met Scotland\'s first minister in a Glasgow hotel as she prepares to formally trigger Article 50. Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon held talks for about an hour during the prime minister\'s trip to Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said the talks were cordial but she was \"frustrated by a process that appears not to be listening\". The prime minister had earlier repeated her opposition to an independence referendum during the Brexit process. The Scottish Parliament is expected to back Ms Sturgeon\'s call for a referendum on Tuesday. The first minister says a fresh vote is needed ahead of Brexit to allow the people of Scotland to choose which path to follow. Mrs May has repeatedly said that \"now is not the time\" for an independence referendum, but has not ruled out one being held after the Brexit process is complete. Ahead of the meeting, the prime minister said leaving the European Union would be an opportunity to strengthen the ties between the nations of the United Kingdom. Ms Sturgeon later told BBC Scotland that she had wished the prime minister well for the forthcoming negotiations with the EU, which she said the Scottish government wanted to play a constructive part in. But she said she had been frustrated that Mrs May had not made any concessions over the first minister\'s demands for a distinctive Brexit deal for Scotland. ANALYSIS The prime and first ministers do not see eye to eye. Not out of badness but because they disagree fundamentally and deeply about the future of Scotland. Such differences cannot be elided by a relatively short chat in a Glasgow hotel. There was symbolism surrounding all of the prime minister\'s visit. Theresa May was out to demonstrate that Scotland was a key part of her thinking ahead of the triggering of Article 50 on Wednesday, beginning the process of removing Britain from the EU. The first minister also said Mrs May had told her that she expects the terms of the UK\'s future relationship with the EU to become clear within the next 18 to 24 months - within Ms Sturgeon\'s timetable for an independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon said: \"I have said that I want people in Scotland to have an informed choice when the terms of Brexit are clear. \"She has confirmed to me today that that will be in a period from autumn next year to the spring of 2019. That would underline my view that is the right timescale\". Mrs May, who will trigger Article 50 on Wednesday, earlier told staff at the Department for International Development (DFID) in East Kilbride that she wanted Brexit to lead to a \"more united nation\". She pledged that leaving the EU would not mean the UK \"stepping back from the world\", and insisted she was aiming to build \"a new partnership with Europe\" while taking the opportunity to build \"a more global Britain\". The prime minister added: \"As Britain leaves the European Union, and we forge a new role for ourselves in the world, the strength and stability of our Union will become even more important. In an impassioned plea for the preservation of the UK, she said the nations of the United Kingdom were an \"unstoppable force\" when they acted together. Mrs May - who did not take questions following her 10-minute speech, which focused largely on DFID\'s international aid work - also said the UK was \"a force for good, helping to build a better future for everyone\". She added: \"As we look to that future and as we face this great national moment together, I hope you will continue to play your part in the great national effort we need to build the stronger Britain, the fairer Britain, the more outward-looking Britain and the more united Britain that I am determined we should be once we emerge from this period of national change.\"Mrs May insists that there have been \"considerable discussions\" with the Scottish government and the UK\'s other devolved administrations as she seeks to get the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK. Six tests And she has said that there are areas where the UK and Scottish governments are in agreement, such as workers\' rights. Mrs May was speaking as that will need to be met in order for it to support any Brexit deal negotiated by the government. Downing Street had said that the talks between Mrs May and Ms Sturgeon were for issues surrounding the triggering of Article 50 - and not the possibility of a second independence referendum. But Scottish government sources said ahead of the meeting that the talks could not just focus on Brexit. Triggering Article 50 begins a two-year negotiation process to attempt to reach a deal before Britain officially leaves the EU in March 2019. The government is also due to publish its Great Repeal Bill, giving powers to amend some EU laws, on Thursday. ',politics
'Uber president Jeff Jones steps down Uber president Jeff Jones is leaving the company after less than six months. A source at the taxi booking app told the BBC the resignation was \"completely unexpected\". They said Mr Jones was frustrated the company was hiring a new chief operating officer and that he was not among the candidates. But , Mr Jones left because of Uber\'s continued struggle with issues around sexism and sexual harassment. He told the magazine that the \"beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber\". Uber said in a statement on Sunday: \"We want to thank Jeff for his six months at the company and wish him all the best.\" Privately, however, the company has been shocked by his sudden departure, with other executives left disappointed at what they saw as a lack of professional courtesy in informing them of his plans. His resignation will take effect immediately, the BBC understands.\'Leadership help\' Uber has suffered a spate of controversies in 2017, the most serious being ongoing rows over . After being filmed arguing with a driver over falling rates, the firm\'s co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick admitted he needed \"leadership help\". Earlier this month, he announced that the company was looking for a chief operating officer (COO). The role would have effectively demoted Mr Jones, who was not himself being considered for the position. In an email to his staff on Sunday, Mr Kalanick said: \"After we announced our intention to hire a COO, Jeff came to the tough decision that he doesn\'t see his future at Uber. \"It is unfortunate that this was announced through the press, but I thought it was important to send all of you an email before providing comment publicly.\"The backroom manoeuvrings could suggest bigger changes at Uber are on the way. Two separate, well-placed sources at the company told the BBC that Mr Kalanick could possibly step down as chief executive soon after the new COO is in place - a move that might reassure investors ahead of a long-anticipated potential initial public offering. A spokesperson for Uber would not comment on the suggestion. However, shortly after this story was published, another source, who also did not want to be named, said there was \"zero chance\" of Mr Kalanick stepping down when the new COO is announced. On Monday an Uber spokesperson told the BBC that Mr Kalanick had no plans to resign.',tech

'Budget: What do businesses want? When it comes to Wednesday\'s Budget, British businesses have drawn up their wish-lists and argued their case with the Chancellor, Philip Hammond. This Spring two themes have emerged: reforming Britain\'s business rates and ensuring economic stability as the country prepares to start Brexit negotiations with the European Union. Here are the highlights of what Britain\'s business bosses are calling for. Confederation of British Industry: \'Prioritise stability\' The government must work in partnership with firms to prioritise stability as Britain starts Brexit talks, says the .\"By supporting businesses to invest, the government can promote growth at a critical time for the UK economy as we enter into EU exit negotiations,\" said CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn. The CBI says that as uncertainty about how the UK leaves the EU dampens investment and higher inflation erodes consumer spending growth, \"the government must show it is serious about supporting companies to invest, to help our regions and nations prosper\". In its Budget submission letter, the group urges the government to make sure it does not add to the mounting burden of costs facing firms for just doing business.\"Prioritising stability will inject further confidence in the economy now, and help boost the country\'s productivity and prosperity for the future,\" says CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith. British Chambers of Commerce: Business rates reform For the BCC, it is \"all about business rates\". It wants Mr Hammond to deliver \"real reform\" to the business rates system. \"Despite attempts by successive governments to introduce marginal reforms, the fundamental unfairness of business rates remains,\" says BCC director-general . The government should end the \"fiscal neutrality principle\" in business rates reforms, it says. This means there are winners and losers across the country from reforms but limits the government\'s scope to bring about fundamental changes, it argues. The BCC is also calling for further changes on business rates: Bringing forward the switch in how rates are adjusted for inflation, moving from using RPI to CPI to April 2017 (this change is currently due in April 2020) Removing all plant and machinery from property valuation for business rates purposes Ending proposals to restrict the ability of the Valuation Tribunal for England to order changes to business rates liabilities \"Businesses from across the Chamber network of all sizes, sectors and locations, lament the burden of this high up-front cost, which they are forced to pay before making even a penny of profit,\" says Dr Marshall. SMMT: \'prioritise technologies\' For the UK\'s car industry it is vital that the chancellor does nothing to harm the sector\'s competitiveness, which is \"very internationally exposed,\" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. He wants a reform of the business rates system to encourage investment in plant and machinery and additional funding for supply chain companies to boost skills levels and productivity. Measures to boost the uptake of low emission vehicles will also be good news, Mr Hawes says. There has been speculation ahead of the Budget that Mr Hammond intends to provide more details about his Industrial Strategy and investment plans. Mr Hawes said: \"We must also prioritise technologies of the future such as connected and autonomous vehicles and the digitalisation of manufacturing which could yield significant economic advantages for the UK in years ahead.\" Institute of Directors: \'fit for the future\' \"There is a risk that Brexit distracts attention from the pressing need to make sure the UK economy is fit for the future,\" . Mr Hammond should act to \"re-energise\" the UK business community, says the IoD. While the government needs to act to help small businesses facing business rate hikes, \"we should also look to the future, launching a new Tax Commission to look at what the growth of self-employment and online business mean for the tax system,\" says Mr Martin.\"The goal must be a much more level playing-field, which treats both High Street and online businesses fairly and adapts to the growth of the \'platform economy\', which is leading to an increase in flexible work.\"The IoD also wants to see an increase in the Annual Investment Allowance cap to £1m to boost investment by small and medium-sized businesses. The government should reiterate its manifesto pledge for the UK to have the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7 countries. This is set to fall to 17\% by 2020, but if President Trump cuts US corporation tax to 15\% the UK should follow-suit, it says. It also wants to see consultation on a simpler tax system for small businesses. Mr Hammond should create a \'white-list\' for acceptable tax-planning, to separate it from aggressive evasion, so businesses are clear about what kinds of tax planning HMRC will accept. It wants the government to consult on liberalising investment schemes for start-ups. The rules for the Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trusts are too restrictive and unnecessarily complex for entrepreneurs seeking equity funding, says the IoD. EEF: Boosting R&amp; D The manufacturers\' organisation wants Mr Hammond to maintain his focus on boosting productivity and pressing ahead with infrastructure investment to ensure businesses are ready for \"for post-Brexit success\", says the EEF. The government must \"enable more research and innovation, skills development and higher levels of investment\" - critical for future growth and productivity across British manufacturing. The chancellor should also act decisively to end the annual bout of controversy about the UK business rates system., it says. \"Action that enables more innovation, more investment and supports better skills and infrastructure in the economy are not optional if the UK is to be ready to make the most of post-Brexit opportunities,\" says EEF chief economist Lee Hopley. The EEF is also calling for competitive funding for the government\'s new institutes of technology, and that the Institute for Apprenticeships should be operational ahead of the new levy being introduced in April. Federation of Small Businesses: \'be pro-business\' The is calling for has a \"pro-business Budget that boosts jobs and long-term growth\". The Chancellor should use the Budget to show he backs British businesses to improve job creation and drive productivity - and carry out urgent business rates reform.\"The broken business rates system needs radical change. It\'s time for the Government to indicate it seeks a sensible, fair system for the 21st century that reflects businesses\' ability to pay,\" says FSB national chairman Mike Cherry. The Budget is a chance for Mr Hammond to recognise that while \"small businesses are the engines of job creation, spiralling labour costs are now threatening their growth ambitions and hiring intentions,\" he says. City of London Corporation: \'Certainty and clarity\' The Budget should deliver as much certainty as possible for City firms and preserving the Square Mile\'s \"number one global financial centre position\", says the City of London Corporation. The City also wants to ensure \"the fullest possible Single Market access... [and] strong trade links with international partners, maintaining our ability to attract highly-skilled workers,\" says a Corporation spokesman. \"Certainty and clarity is key.\" ',business
'Exclusive: Ed Sheeran says Liberia trip \'hit me really hard\' Ed Sheeran writes exclusively for BBC News about his trip to Liberia with Comic Relief and why he\'ll never forget the children he met there - and one young girl in particular. I knew I wanted to get involved in Red Nose Day this year. But then I decided to take it one step further. I\'d wanted to go on a Comic Relief trip for years and here was the perfect opportunity, so I agreed to take my first ever trip to Liberia in West Africa. During the trip, we visited a school in West Point, the largest and most dangerous slum in Liberia\'s capital, Monrovia. It was really shocking seeing the appalling conditions that people live in and it was far worse than I could have ever imagined. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw, but despite all of this, everyone\'s positivity was overwhelming. The welcome from the kids was amazing, especially when they saw my tattoos; they went nuts and couldn\'t understand what they were. Some of the younger kids tried to wipe them off. Everyone wanted to know what we were doing and where we were from. They absolutely loved singing and clapping along to my songs and for a few hours it was easy to forget that these kids live in such awful conditions. I was completely blown away by their eagerness to learn. They really wanted to be in school and all had big dreams for the future. Despite living in one of the poorest places on Earth, they weren\'t prepared to let their circumstances hold them back. I asked a lot of them what they wanted to be when they grow up and \"doctor\", \"teacher\" and \"politician\" were common responses. I got a sense that they really meant it. They\'ve seen what life is like for people with no qualifications or jobs and it\'s the motivation they need to keep studying. There are hundreds of thousands of people crammed in to West Point, most of them living in squalor, so getting an education is a privilege and not something all of the kids get to do. As we were taking a break from filming, a little girl came over to talk to me. Her name was Peaches and unlike the other children I\'d met, she wasn\'t in a uniform. She explained that since her father\'s death during the Ebola crisis, her mother couldn\'t afford to send her to school any more. At just 12 years old, she had already been working for over a year helping to support her family. Unfortunately, Peaches\' story is not uncommon. We had an impromptu jamming session and the girl could really sing. Peaches sang a song that reminded her of her father and as she did, tears started to roll down her face. The enthusiasm that was initially shining out of her disappeared. It was at this point that the reality of Peaches\' situation, and many, many kids just like her, hit me really hard. Peaches told me she wanted to be a musician when she grows up, and who knows, maybe she can make that happen, but for now, she has been forced to drop out of school and spends her days working in a filthy, dangerous slum, earning what she can to help feed her family. It is because of kids like Peaches and the thousands more like her across Africa that I am relieved that Red Nose Day exists. West Point is like a forgotten world, shut away from the rest of the civilisation, yet the money you raise in the UK is helping the kids that live there. So many of them don\'t have a childhood the way you or I would recognise it: they struggle every day just to survive. During my trip I got to visit a project that\'s using Comic Relief cash to help abandoned children and those not in school across Liberia. Because of public donations, many children will be able to go back to school and get an education. For a lot of them this is their only chance of a better future and a life outside of the slum. I\'ve no doubt that with the right opportunities Peaches absolutely could be a singer, or a teacher, or she could very well end up running the country. Just a small amount of money can make such a big difference in a place like West Point and at least gives these kids a fighting chance. I know this because I\'ve seen it with my own eyes. Just £45 could be life-changing to someone like Peaches, it could pay for a child in Liberia to go to school for a whole year. I really hope the money we raise this Red Nose Day can help thousands of children, just like Peaches, to follow their dreams. Red Nose Day 2017 airs at 19: 00 GMT on BBC One on Friday, and will show more from Ed\'s trip to Liberia. ',entertainment
'Disability benefits: Number 10 defends changes to PIPs Downing Street has defended plans to change access to disability benefits, saying that \"nobody is losing out\". The government wants to reverse the effects of a court ruling which expands the number of people who can claim Personal Independence Payments. The PM\'s official spokesman said the welfare system was a \"strong safety net for those who are in need of it\". Meanwhile, a No 10 aide apologised for any offence after saying benefits should go to \"really disabled people\". No 10 policy unit head George Freeman had faced calls to apologise after saying on Sunday those \"taking pills at home, who suffer from anxiety\" should not receive Personal Independence Payments. On Monday he tweeted: \"Having experienced myself traumatic anxiety as a child carer living w alcohol I know all too well the pain anxiety + depression causes...\"Which is why as a former health minister and policy adviser I am passionate about supporting mental health and disability, and hugely regret if my comment about the need to prioritise the most \'serious disabilities\' inadvertently caused any offence which was not intended.\" The prime minister\'s official spokesman said the Personal Independence Payments (PIP) reforms were not about saving money and said that about £50bn a year was spent on supporting people with disabilities and health conditions.\"The government has been clear on the parity of esteem we want to see between mental and physical health,\" the spokesman said.\"What we are doing now is restoring the original intention of the PIPs which was to make sure there was a sustainable benefit to provide continued support to those who face the greatest barrier to living independent lives.\" Pressed on whether the prime minister had a message for those who could be affected by the changes, the spokesman said \"nobody is losing out\". He said a recent tribunal on assessments for PIP payments had \"broadened\" the criteria. The government is proposing changes to PIPs, which replaced the Disability Living Allowance, after tribunal rulings that claimants with psychological problems who cannot travel without help must be treated like those who are blind. The government says the rulings - if unchallenged - would have added £3. 7bn to the benefits bill by 2023. The benefit is intended to help people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs. Disabilities minister Penny Mordaunt said she was reforming the PIP payments to \"restore the original aim of the benefit\" to make sure support was given to the most needy. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he was \"furious\" about the proposed changes to PIPS, and said Labour would pressurise the government to reverse them in next month\'s Budget. The Liberal Democrats said the government was using court losses \"as an excuse to severely restrict disability benefits\".',politics
'Security flaws \'undiscovered for years\' Security holes known as zero-day vulnerabilities can lie dormant for up to 10 years, a study has suggested. And this means that hackers have plenty of time to develop sophisticated exploits for a range of software. The study, from research organisation Rand, looked at 200 security flaws, 40\% of which are not yet publicly known. It comes as documents from Wikileaks suggest the CIA has collected a portfolio of zero-day vulnerabilities. The study suggests: 25\% of vulnerabilities become publicly known within one and a half years 25\% remain undiscovered for more than nine and a half years Vulnerabilities that are publicly known are often disclosed with a patch Once a vulnerability is found, an exploit can be developed in an average of 22 days Lillian Ablon, lead author of the study, said that \"deciding whether to stockpile or publicly disclose a zero-day vulnerability is game of trade-offs, particularly for governments\".\"Looking at it from the perspective of national governments, if one\'s adversaries also know about the vulnerability, then publicly disclosing the flaw would help strengthen one\'s own defence by compelling the affected vendor to implement a patch and protect against the adversary using the vulnerability against them,\" Ms Ablon said. \"On the other hand, publicly disclosing a vulnerability that isn\'t known by one\'s adversaries gives them the upper hand, because the adversary could then protect against any attack using that vulnerability, while still keeping an inventory of vulnerabilities of which only it is aware of in reserve. \"In that case, stockpiling would be the best option.\"Stuxnet, one of the most high profile pieces of malware in recent years, relied on four Microsoft zero-day exploits to compromise Iran\'s nuclear programme. Wikileaks claims that, as of last year, the CIA has built up an arsenal of 24 Android zero-day vulnerabilities. Google later said Android and Chrome users should be protected from many of the exploits, thanks to security updates and patches. Art Swift, president of the PRPL Foundation, which champions open-source software, told the BBC: \"The irony of these findings is that in the government\'s attempt to protect US citizens from cyber-attacks, it\'s actually exposing them to cybercriminals and nation-state attackers in the worst way.\"By using these flaws and encouraging vendor backdoors, it actually weakens the whole system.\"',tech
'Six Nations 2017: Wales unchanged to face Ireland Wales have named an unchanged starting team and bench to face Ireland in the Six Nations on Friday. Coach Rob Howley has resisted calls to bring in fresh faces following defeats by Scotland and England. Dan Biggar has held off Sam Davies\' challenge at fly-half and George North remains on the wing with Ross Moriarty preferred at eight to Taulupe Faletau. Ireland\'s also stays the same with Tommy Bowe replacing injured winger Andrew Trimble on the bench. Howley said: \"There is a lot of experience in our group. You don\'t become a bad team overnight. \"As coaches we discussed possibly giving the side a chance to redeem themselves for the second half performance [against Scotland].\"There were too many forced and unforced errors in that game, I thought we were dominant for the first half against Scotland and that was off the back of one of the best games in the Six Nations against England for 75 minutes. \"This is a good team and we\'ve got the opportunity to go out in front of our home supporters and deliver a performance the players are proud of and it\'s equally important for the supporters to support that.\"It\'s going to be a huge game on Friday night.\"In the build-up to the announcement, Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards said North had been warned about his form. Open-side flanker Justin Tipuric will win his 50th Wales cap. He has also played once for the British and Irish Lions. Injury concern over Charteris Howley had been expected to change his back row and second row, with Bath pair Faletau and Luke Charteris tipped to start. Howley said the fact Faletau played for Bath against Wasps in the English Premiership was factor in the decision to retain the number eight on the bench while Charteris is named among the replacements despite the fact he is still undergoing return to play protocols after taking a blow to the head in that match.\"It would have been a six-day turnaround, they both played on Saturday and the pitch at Bath is pretty heavy,\" added Howley.\"Luke had concussion, he came off in that game. He\'s gone through the HIA (head injury assessment) process but wasn\'t able to train Saturday and Sunday.\"Luke passed the HIA on the day, he\'s done checks up until this point [Wednesday], he\'s just got his contact protocol to go through and he\'ll be fine.\" Wales beat Italy in their opening game, but defeats by England and Scotland have meant a drop to seventh in the World Rugby global rankings. A loss to Ireland and another against France on 18 March could mean Wales going into May\'s 2019 World Cup draw in ninth position and facing another \"group of death\" in Japan having endured similar circumstances in 2015. On that occasion, Wales beat hosts England on their way to the quarter-finals, but lost to eventual finalists Australia in their pool game.

'Sir Philip Green strikes BHS pension deal with regulator Sir Philip Green has agreed a £363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap in the BHS pension scheme. Workers will get the same starting pension that they were originally promised. It brings to a close a long-running negotiation over benefits for former workers of the collapsed retailer. The regulator had launched enforcement action against Sir Philip and other former owners of BHS.\'Sorry chapter\' Sir Philip, who had promised to \"sort\" the pension scheme, said: \"I have today made a voluntary contribution of up to £363m to enable the trustees of the BHS Pension schemes to achieve a significantly better outcome than the schemes entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which was the goal from the outset. \"The settlement follows lengthy, complex discussions with the Pensions Regulator and the PPF, both of which are satisfied with the solution that has been offered.\"All relevant notices, including legal matters and claims from the regulator, have been withdrawn, bringing this matter to a conclusion.\" The tycoon, who with his wife Cristina is estimated by Forbes to be worth £3. 8bn, said: \"Once again I would like to apologise to the BHS pensioners for this last year of uncertainty, which was clearly never the intention when the business was sold in March 2015.\"I hope that this solution puts their minds at rest and closes this sorry chapter for them.\"What the deal means for BHS pensioners The negotiations centred on getting the 19, 000 members of the scheme a pension that was closer to the one they were originally promised. Usually, failed pension schemes are rescued by the Pension Protection Fund, which pays out a reduced amount. Had the PPF taken on the scheme, members aged under 60 would have seen a 10\% reduction in their starting pension. Following Sir Philip\'s cash injection, they will now be transferred to a new scheme with the same starting pension that they had originally been promised. Subsequent payments will not be as generous as they had originally thought had the retailer survived, owing to less inflation protection. On average, the new scheme will offer members of around 88\% of the value of their full BHS scheme benefits. Yet, these long-term payouts are better than they would have been under the PPF. Benefits payable in retirement and built up prior to April 1997 will increase at 1. 8\% per year. Members can opt to take a lump sum if they have a pension pot of up to £18, 000. There will be no cap on pension payouts, which would have been the case under the PPF and would have hit those with bigger pensions. Current pensioners will also receive a lump sum to make up for any underpaid pension benefits since March 2016, when the scheme, in effect, was under PPF rules during an assessment period. The Pensions Regulator chief executive Lesley Titcomb described the deal as \"strong\". \"Throughout our discussions with Sir Philip and his team, we have always been clear that we were determined to achieve the right outcome for members of the schemes, both in terms of the amount and the structure of the settlement.\"There was an estimated £571m hole in the BHS pension covering all future payouts. The potential of taking on such a burden was seen as one of the reasons that BHS failed to find backers or buyers for the business at a whole. In practical terms, the hit to the PPF of taking on the scheme would have been £275m or more. Sir Philip initially offered £250m, but the regulator had sought at least £350m - an ambition that it has now achieved. Another £20m from Sir Philip is being used to cover expenses. MPs had also called for the Topshop billionaire to be stripped of his knighthood. He was grilled by a committee of MPs over the sale of the chain, which he owned for 15 years before selling it for £1 to former bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Mr Chappell is still being pursued by the regulator.\'Just enough\' Anne and Keith Bostock, from Stockport, met while working at BHS. She worked in customer services, and he was on the tills and in deliveries. Anne worked for BHS for 42 years, and Keith for six.\"A lot of pensioners will feel a bit better about it, but it has taken a long time,\" said Keith, regarding the deal.\"It is a case of doing just enough to keep him [Sir Philip] out of trouble.\"I am hopeful they will still get rid of his knighthood. He is projecting the wrong image for business.\"\'Not justice\' Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions Select Committee and who had suggested the retail tycoon\'s yacht could be seized to help shore up the pension fund, said: \"I very much welcome this out-of-court settlement, which is an important milestone in gaining the justice for BHS pensioners and former workers that we have been pushing for since beginning our inquiry into the downfall of BHS.\"I think there are a lot of other issues which are not solved by this which we will obviously be looking at and the courts and everybody else will be.\"It is not justice, but it is a milestone.\"Shop workers union USDAW questioned why it had taken so long for Sir Philip to \"pull some money out his pocket\".\"Why has it taken from his first promise in June to actually get to now, the end of February, for him to actually put some kind of money into the pot,\" said David Gill, the National Officer for USDAW. But he added the union was pleased with the funds, calling it a \"move in the right direction\". Chris Martin, chairman of the BHS Pension Trustees, said: \"The injection of cash from Sir Philip puts the new scheme on a stable footing.\" He said members would be contacted to be updated on their options.',business
'Buffy the Vampire Slayer: How the show influenced modern entertainment It\'s been 20 years since Buffy The Vampire Slayer first hit our TV screens. It has fans all over the world, and made a star of its lead actress Sarah Michelle Gellar. A TV series based on a not-great movie about a Californian teenager who attends high school by day and fights vampires by night, seems an unlikely candidate to be a serious contender to become a TV classic and hugely influential piece of popular culture. But Buffy managed it and after close to 150 episodes - with its final outing airing in 2003 - its influence is still felt today as a truly ground breaking piece of work. Here are some of the things that Buffy has given the world of entertainment. Strong, complex women on screen. In TV and film it\'s all too common for female characters to be the love interest or the support to a male lead. Buffy successfully put a woman at the centre of the series, and led the way for characters like The Hunger Games\' Katniss Everdeen, The Force Awakens\' Rey, Homeland\'s Carrie Mathison, and so many more. Whip-smart dialogue filled with great pop culture references. This was a trademark feature of Buffy - one example, after a gruesome multiple murder at a college fraternity house, a demon approvingly comments: \"It\'s like somebody slaughtered an Abercrombie and Fitch catalogue.\" Series ranging from Gilmore Girls to Family Guy gleefully use dialogue in a similar, although less gruesome, way. Joss Whedon! Buffy\'s show runner is now one of the biggest names in Hollywood. Two of the films in the Top 10 highest grossing of all time were directed by him - Marvel\'s The Avengers and its sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron. Both took over $1. 5bn (£1. 23bn) and he also had a role overseeing other successful Marvel films. And it all started with the experience he got writing and directing Buffy. Standalone storylines with an ongoing narrative leading up to an end of series \'Big Bad\'. When writer/producer Russell T Davies re-launched Doctor Who in 2005, he changed its format to one that was similar in many ways to Buffy. The episodes in each series lead up to a climax where the main threat has been bubbling under the surface for several episodes. La La Land? Without Buffy\'s brilliant musical episode Once More, With Feeling would Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone\'s movie ever have been green-lit? Actually, yes, it would have been. But if you enjoyed the singing dancing love letter to LA which didn\'t win best film at this year\'s Oscars, you could do worse than to check out Buffy\'s musical extravaganza. It\'s exactly like La La Land, but with added demons. It also set a trend for other TV shows to unexpectedly feature a musical episode halfway through a series, including medical comedy Scrubs and medical drama Grey\'s Anatomy - and an upcoming Supergirl/The Flash crossover. Thanks Buffy, you saved the world - a lot. ',entertainment
'Heseltine to Theresa May: There was no need to sack me Lord Heseltine has told Theresa May she did not need to sack him for rebelling over Brexit. He was fired from five government advisory roles after backing a House of Lords demand for a \"meaningful\" parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal. In a letter to Mrs May, the former deputy prime minister said that, unlike her, he had not changed his mind having backed Remain before the referendum. The Brexit bill has since received Royal Assent. Lord Heseltine thanked the PM for the \"kind remarks\" in her letter to him, saying his role had been to offer advice that ministers were \"free to accept, reject or ignore\". He added: \"You say in your letter that I will understand the necessity to end that relationship. Here we disagree. \"In the referendum campaign it was recognised that so deeply held and so divided were the views on both sides that members of the cabinet and other ministers were free to argue and vote against the government\'s European policy without sanction.\"\'Excellent speech\' He said his vote against the government could not have delayed or denied Mrs May\'s ability to trigger withdrawal talks under Article 50 of the EU treaties. He added: \"I have repeatedly said you have every right to end my relationship with the government.\"The simple fact remains that you have changed your mind since the excellent speech you made in the referendum campaign arguing that we should remain in the European Union. I have not.\"In a statement released at the time of Lord Heseltine\'s sacking, the government said it had \"a clearly stated and consistent position\" that the Brexit bill should be passed without amendment. The chief whip in the Lords asked Lord Heseltine to stand down because he voted against the government\'s official position, it said, adding: \"The government would like to warmly thank Lord Heseltine for his service.\"',politics
'Tomorrow\'s cities: Stockholm turns green Smart is a word that has long prefaced a whole range of technology, from watches to fridges to homes. It might sound cool to marketers, but consumers are increasingly questioning just how clever these devices really are. Now, cities are jumping on the bandwagon and giving themselves the same title whenever they implement technology solutions. For some, that involves flashy and expensive command-and-control centres from which they view traffic flow and data collected from sensors around the city. Sweden\'s capital, Stockholm, has taken a different, quieter approach, but, along the way, has garnered over seven million euros (£5. 9m) of EU money and become a leading example of how to do \"smart\". It has been designated as an EU \"lighthouse\" city - alongside Barcelona and Cologne - meaning the projects it implements, if successful, can then be copied in other European towns. Stockholm\'s interpretation of smart is about becoming greener - it hopes to be fossil-fuel free by 2040 and sees eco-policies as the smartest thing not only for the city but for the planet. Stockholm is already pretty eco-friendly. Bio-fuel, generated from sewage, is available at petrol stations around the city, and regularly used by taxis and cars. And now, the city wants to extend its use to larger vans and lorries, which are particularly polluting, and explore ways to make the fuel more efficient.\"One hundred people going to the toilet powers one car, but if we add organic household waste, that goes down to 60 people,\" said Gustaf Landahl, who heads up the Grow Smarter project. Stockholm is also working with energy company Fortum to take advantage of a city-wide heating system, to use waste heat generated from data centres, supermarkets and stadiums to provide heat for residents around the city. The fact the city has a network of underground pipes - which comprises 2, 800km of piping connected to around 10, 000 buildings in the city - means that waste heat - in the form of hot water - can easily be added to the grid. In another project, the city plans to re-use wasted heat from a 30, 000-seater stadium in a nearby development of houses, shops and restaurants. Another deal has just been reached, with data centre GleSys, which will see recovered heat able to serve the heating needs of more than 1, 000 flats. There is a trend for technology companies, under pressure to make their data centres greener, to relocate to colder countries. In 2013, Facebook opened a data centre in the remote northern Swedish town of Lulea. But not everyone is convinced this was really that green.\"In Sweden\'s cold climate heat has value. Selling and reusing the data centre waste heat for residential heating is sustainable as well as profitable. Therefore you should not put your data centre in the woods where the heat can\'t be recovered,\" said Fortum\'s head of open district heating, Erik Rylander. \"That Facebook data centre could have heated 90, 000 homes if it had been located where the heat could be re-used\"Now, Stockholm is actively campaigning to persuade technology businesses to locate their data centres to the capital. The city also has the world\'s largest open-fibre network, which provides cheap city-wide fast broadband to most residents, who pay about 20 to 25 euros per month for a 1GB service. Now, that network is also helping support sensors around the city, seen by many as the best way of measuring what is going on in the urban environment. This will begin on a small scale in a neglected area of the city, which will be transformed by 2025 into a trendy revitalised zone, with homes, shops and restaurants. The area will boast smart bus-stops offering information, wi-fi access and sensors that measure traffic flow and air quality. It would, said Mika Hakosalo the site manager for Stockholm\'s environment administration, help the city understand how its citizens moved around. \"Our target in GrowSmarter is to reduce the transport emissions by 60\%, so we will use the data to understand underlying factors affecting the transport emissions in a given area to be able to find and test solutions to reduce them.\"The city is creating several eco-districts made up of new-builds as well as retro-fitted older buildings. All are being made as environmentally friendly and heat-efficient as possible - with the use of innovative insulation schemes and solar-panels on roofs. Mr Landahl said it was important citizens were at the centre of any changes.\"We have to improve the quality of life, we can\'t just work with technology for technology\'s sake,\" he said.\"We are building energy-efficient buildings, but we need to make people who live there energy-efficient too,\" Changing user behaviour is starting in small steps. On one newly built privately owned estate, residents are provided with tablets that show their real-time energy usage in an attempt to make them better understand how they use and waste gas, water and electricity. As well as seeing their light, heat and water consumption in real-time, residents can also track their usage over a period of time, see the best times to run appliances and compare their usage with that of their neighbours. Meanwhile, on a public housing estate - built in the 1960s and in desperate need of renovation - residents will get not only more energy-efficient homes but also a new smart rubbish collection system. Each household will have different coloured bags to collect different types of rubbish. All bags will be thrown into communal chutes on the estate, from where it will enter an underground vacuum system that will take the rubbish to an optical sorting centre. Sensors in the chutes will identify different coloured bags, and it will be possible, if residents agree to it, to measure exactly what people are throwing away, with awards for those who are greenest. Director of marketing at Envac Jonas Tornblom talked about the wider benefits to the city of having an underground bin system.\"It reduces the movement of waste lorries in residential areas and city centres, resulting in fewer accidents and less noise and pollution,\" he said.\"It also makes for better working conditions for waste collection workers, saves space for developers and means less littering.\" Stockholm cannot become greener without help from eco-businesses, such as car-sharing schemes, but, here, the journey has not always been smooth. In November, car-sharing service Car2Go announced it was withdrawing its services from the city. A notice on its website said: \"Despite our efforts and the loyal business partners, we did not reach the necessary number of members or car usage.\"So perhaps there is still a long road to persuading citizens an eco-city is something that makes sense for them as well as for those who run it.',tech
'Leigh Halfpenny: Wales full back admits \'mistake\' over spurned penalty Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny has admitted he \"made a mistake\" in turning down a kick at goal during the by Scotland. Wales kicked for the corner while trailing 16-13 in the 51st minute. The Toulon full-back said he chose not to kick even though captain Alun Wyn Jones wanted the three points. \"For me, I need to hold my hand up. I made a mistake and I wasn\'t decisive enough,\" Halfpenny told \"Alun Wyn wanted to go for the three points and I\'ve allowed errors in my game before and the conditions to influence me and turn down the kick. \"I should have parked those mistakes and moved on.\"In the past I have made errors and not allowed those to effect me and moved onto the next job. It\'s probably the first time it has happened but it\'s the last time it will.\"Jones told a media conference on Tuesday that he had changed his mind about opting for the kick at goal after taking to Halfpenny.\"Obviously I\'m not a kicker and I thought it was a good shot, Leigh didn\'t feel the same way hence we\'ve gone for the corner,\" said Jones.\"I have every faith in him [Halfpenny]. Leigh\'s a world-class kicker and he knows what he can and can\'t do.\"Lock forward Jones confirmed he had initially indicated to referee John Lacey that Wales would go for goal. During television coverage of the incident fly-half Dan Biggar could clearly be heard asking if he should kick for the corner and Lacey saying a kick at goal was \"indicated\". It has led to media speculation that Biggar - an Ospreys team-mate of Jones - had influenced the decision not to take the kick which could have levelled the scores. Asked to explain the chain of events surrounding the penalty which was awarded on the Scotland 22 metre line close to the attacking team\'s left-hand touchline, Jones explained: \"I motioned to the posts a couple of times and the ref agreed with me.\"Leigh felt the conditions weren\'t right and fortunately we were still able to go to the lineout.\"I suppose when you captain your country leadership and critiquing of things you do and the things you say are always going to be there.\"Jones also explained why he did not ask Dan Biggar - who has kicked more than 100 goals for Wales - to have a shot at goal.\"In all honesty and in fairness, Dan\'s said because of his respect for Leigh he didn\'t want to be seen to undermine him [Halfpenny] or myself so that\'s why I went to the lineout,\" he said.\"Obviously from my point of view to level the scores would have been a good place to be midway through the second half particularly the way possession and territory had gone.\"',sport

'Beauty and the Beast: Russia considers ban over \'gay moment\' Russian officials are coming under pressure to check if Disney\'s new film Beauty and the Beast breaches the country\'s law against \"gay propaganda\". Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said action would be taken after the checks while an MP described the film as \"shameless propaganda of sin\". The live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast features Disney\'s first ever gay character and love scene. A Russian law prohibits the spreading of \"gay propaganda\" among minors. The 2013 legislation, which has angered human rights activists and the international gay community, describes homosexuality as \"non-traditional sexual relations\". Homosexuality was decriminalised in Russia in 1993 and the country officially removed it from a list of psychiatric disorders in 1999. However, homophobic attacks have been documented in recent years. Director Bill Condon has spoken of an in Beauty and the Beast. It involves LeFou, who is a sidekick of the film\'s main antagonist Gaston. LeFou, played by US actor Josh Gad, tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between lust and admiration, as a side-plot to the main story. The movie is due to be released in Russia on 16 March. But Vitaly Milonov, an MP of the governing United Russia party, urged the culture minister to hold a screening of the film before it was released to see if it complied with the law and to \"take measures to totally ban\" it if he found \"elements of propaganda of homosexuality\". His colleague Alexander Sholokhov said that if the scenes violated the law, the film should be banned from cinemas.\"As soon as we get a copy of the film with relevant paperwork for distribution, we will consider it according to the law,\" Mr Medinsky said. Meanwhile, Russian actor Pavel Derevyanko told state-run TV Russia 24, \"I will not take my kid to this movie.\"More on gay rights in Russia When the first Beauty and the Beast trailer was released last year it had almost 130m views in 24 hours.

'Labour membership falls by 26, 000 in six months Labour has lost 26, 000 party members since July, sources have told the BBC. The number of those who cancelled their direct debit payments or let their subscription lapse represents 4. 6\% of the party\'s total 528, 000 membership. Although the majority gave no reason for quitting, party sources said those who did mentioned the party\'s stance on the EU, which is to back Brexit. Despite the fall, Labour\'s total membership is more than 300, 000 higher than it was at the 2015 election. The party enjoyed a surge in membership in the wake of the EU referendum and in the run-up to last year\'s leadership contest, when Jeremy Corbyn beat Owen Smith. More than 500, 000 people voted in that leadership ballot - 285, 000 were party members and the rest registered supporters or union affiliates. The latest membership figures, relate to the period between the leadership contest being called in July 2016 and January this year. The newspaper said the number of those leaving had accelerated since December and the total figure could actually be higher than 26, 000 as those who choose not to renew their subscription take longer to show up on the party\'s system. The BBC\'s political correspondent Iain Watson said sources close to Labour\'s leadership said many of those who had left in the past six months joined to support Mr Corbyn but found they were denied a vote when the party\'s ruling national executive retrospectively imposed a qualifying period for membership. The Labour leader has pointed to the sharp rise in membership since he first ran for the leadership in 2015 as a sign of the strength of the party at grass-roots level and a vindication of the direction he is taking it in. But divisions over Brexit - with a minority of MPs opposing EU withdrawal - and the loss of the Copeland by-election have raised fresh questions about his leadership. Critics claim Labour is on course for a heavy defeat at the next election due in 2020.',politics
'Bad bug found in Microsoft browsing code Google has released details of a bug in Microsoft\'s browsing programs that would allow attackers to build websites that make the software crash. Google researcher Ivan Fratric , in some cases, allow attackers to hijack a victim\'s browser. The bug was found in November, but details are only now being released after the expiry of the 90-day deadline Google gave Microsoft to find a fix. Microsoft has yet to say when it will produce a patch that removes the bug. Quick fix In an of how the bug arose, Mr Fratric said he was reluctant to reveal more details until it was patched. He said he had expected Microsoft to address the bug before the 90-day deadline had expired. The problem is found in Internet Explorer 11 as well as the Edge browser and arises because of the way both programs handle instructions to format some parts of web pages. In a statement, Microsoft did not comment directly on the bug and its significance but said it had a \"customer commitment to investigate reported security issues and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible\". It added it was involved in \"an ongoing conversation with Google about extending their deadline since the disclosure could potentially put customers at risk\". So far, there is no evidence that malicious attackers are exploiting the problem unearthed by Mr Fratric. The publication of information about the browser bug caps a difficult period for Microsoft and the security of its software. Earlier this month, it cancelled a regularly monthly security update without explaining why. The update was expected to include fixes for several significant vulnerabilities. In the same month, other security researchers released information about a way to exploit a vulnerability in some Microsoft server code. No fix has yet been released for this vulnerability.',tech

'Carney defends Bank of England over Hogg resignation Mark Carney has defended the Bank of England\'s handling of Charlotte Hogg\'s resignation during a speech on banking ethics. He said the former deputy governor made a serious but \"honest mistake\" and that the Bank would learn from the affair. But he also warned against an overly punitive approach to misconduct in the banking industry, saying it could leave \"senior managers running scared\". Ms Hogg quit earlier in March over a conflict of interest. She had failed to mention, before her appointment, that her brother was a senior executive at Barclays - a lender regulated by the Bank of England. \'Excessive reliance\' In the speech, Mr Carney said: \"A series of scandals ranging from mis-selling to manipulation have undermined trust in banking, the financial system, and, to some degree, markets themselves. He added: \"The economic consequences have been enormous.

However, he also urged more focus on creating a better banking culture. This included reducing opportunities for bad behaviour and requiring compensation rules \"that align better risk and reward\". He also suggested there had been an \"excessive reliance\" on \"punitive\" fines of firms who misbehaved. \"We have emphasised measures to ensure firms and their employees take responsibility - individually and collectively - for their own conduct,\" he said.\'Transparently admitted\' On Ms Hogg\'s appointment, Mr Carney said he had been clear upfront that there should be consequences for both her and the Bank. However, he called her omission an \"honest mistake that was freely and transparently admitted\" and \"not a firing offence\". He said he respected the Treasury Committee\'s decision to publish a highly critical report on Ms Hogg, as well as her decision to resign. But he said the affair illustrated his wider point about regulation.\"We must not let recent events inadvertently tighten perceived standards for the industry because that could have senior managers running scared, drive compliance underground and undermine our collective objectives.\"Another risk, flagged by some, is that it will also become harder to find candidates of sufficient calibre willing to take on senior roles.\"',business
'David Walliams blames Nightly Show criticism on \'anger\' over ITV News David Walliams has said criticism of ITV\'s Nightly Show is down to anger at the fact it has pushed back the news in the schedule. Walliams hosted the first week of the new talk show, which goes out at 22: 00 GMT - moving the news back to 22: 30. Different hosts have been lined up for each week of its two-month run. But the show has been panned so far.\"Because they moved the news, I think people were sort of angry about that,\" Walliams told BBC Breakfast. With Walliams at the helm, the show was described as \"under-cooked\" by , \"a national embarrassment\" by and \"tripe\" by . It began with overnight viewing figures of 2. 9 million on Monday, but Walliams\'s final show was watched by 1. 2 million on Friday. The comedian said he didn\'t expect it to prove so controversial. \"I guess because the ITV news was moved, I then think people felt, they were sort of comparing it to the news rather than comparing it to other entertainment shows,\" he said. Asked whether there was room for such an entertainment show in the schedules, he replied: \"Yes. I think there is. I think the problem was ITV News was not getting many viewers for ITV so they wanted to try something different.\"But the decision to push the news back turned many viewers and critics against it, he added. John Bishop has taken over as host for the second week - but the reception has been just as savage in some quarters. : \"Clad in sombre black, presumably in mourning for this dead duck, Bishop fared little better [than Walliams]. Arguably even worse.\"Davina McCall and Gordon Ramsay have been announced as future presenters. The show\'s executive producer Katie Taylor has asked viewers to give the show time.: \"We all feel passionately about comedy. People love to sneer at a new experiment but you have to experiment to innovate. We hope everyone grows to love it.\"',entertainment
'RHI and vote transfers light up NI election TV debate The botched Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme remained the hot topic as NI party leaders again clashed over the issue in the second TV election debate. Sinn Féin\'s Michelle O\'Neill said she would not go back into government with DUP leader Arlene Foster while there was a RHI \"cloud hanging over her\". Mrs Foster said there was not a \"scintilla of evidence\" to support corruption allegations over the scheme. Leaders were also put on the spot over to whom they would transfer votes. Mrs Foster criticised Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt for saying during the campaign that he would . \"No serious commentator is saying that with a vote for Mike, you\'d get Colum,\" Mrs Foster said. \"If you vote for Mike, you will get Michelle, that\'s the reality.\"Mr Nesbitt replied: \"People voted for you the last time and they got Martin McGuinness, and he wrote your resignation letter.\"Mrs Foster lost her job as first minister in January after in protest over the DUP\'s handling of the RHI scandal. The second TV debate of the election campaign, hosted by BBC Northern Ireland, featured the leaders of the five biggest parties at Stormont - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Sinn Féin, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Alliance. Mr Eastwood said Mr Nesbitt was \"very brave\" to say he would give his second preference vote to the SDLP and added the public were \"way ahead\" of politicians on cross-community voting. \"I\'m an Irish nationalist, Mike Nesbitt\'s an Ulster Unionist, I won\'t be any less of an Irish nationalist if I transfer across community. It doesn\'t affect one iota my nationalism. I think it\'s the kind of politics that we need to be embracing.\"\'Holding their nose\' Alliance leader Naomi Long said her party had \"fought every election\" on the basis of seeking cross-community support.\"I am glad that other parties are talking about actually co-operating on the basis of doing so voluntarily rather than doing it, as others have said, holding their nose to go into government with each other,\" she said. Mrs Long added that people are tired of being \"pulled back into the ditches\" and wanted to move forward. The snap election was called after a coalition led by the DUP and Sinn Féin collapsed over the handling of the RHI scheme.\'Whiff of corruption\' Former first minister Arlene Foster set up the scheme in 2012 when she was enterprise minister; it was an attempt by the Northern Ireland Executive to increase the creation of heat from renewable sources. But flaws in setting the scheme\'s subsidy rate left it open to abuse as claimants could earn more cash the more fuel they burned; the lack of cost controls led to an overspend that over the next 20 years. Sinn Féin\'s leader north of the border, Michelle O\'Neill, said: \"I cannot go into government with Arlene Foster, in the position of first or deputy first minister, whilst there is a cloud hanging over her. \"The full [RHI] investigation needs to report, but the public will have their say.\" Asked if she would respect her mandate if voters support Mrs Foster, Mrs O\'Neill told the debate she could not dictate who leads the DUP, but could dictate who Sinn Féin enters government with and said the DUP \"will have a choice to make\" after the election. Earlier in the debate, Mrs Foster said there was not a \"scintilla of evidence\" in relation to RHI allegations made against her.\"Would it not have been more intelligent, would it not have been better to have had the public inquiry first and then had the election? Because then we would have had the full facts for everybody to make a judgement,\" she said. The DUP leader has repeatedly warned during the campaign of what she calls Sinn Féin\'s radical Republican agenda, and she used that phrase again several times during the debate. The UUP leader, who has proposed an alternative coalition with the the SDLP, said the DUP and Sinn Féin \"only share space, power and responsibility because the law says they have to\". Mr Nesbitt urged people to vote for change, saying: \"We need an end to 10 years of government hallmarked by incompetence, arrogance, cronyism and the strong whiff of corruption.\"\'Wasted\' Speaking on BBC Newsline Ireland after the debate, leaders of Stormont\'s smaller parties were scathing about the performances of their larger rivals. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said: \"I think the audience saw that there is no prospect of those five parties providing durable, workable good government.\"He added: \"If you vote for these five main parties, you get more of the same - the very thing that isn\'t working.\"Mr Allister said Stormont would never work while it operated under a system that \"insists\" on holding Sinn Féin at the heart of government. Green Party leader Steven Agnew said the debate was a \"wasted\" chance for the five main parties.\"They\'ve wasted the last 10 years in government between them and they\'ve wasted the opportunity to stabilise politics in Northern Ireland.\" He said the Green Party was the \"first to raise problems\" with the RHI scheme and was \"still the only party to propose a workable solution\".\'Take a kicking\' People Before Profit\'s Fiona Ferguson said: \"Not once tonight did we hear about the crippling austerity that has been bringing our community to its knees for the past 10 years. \"We also didn\'t hear about any sort of solution to the housing crisis nor the healthcare crisis that faces most people in this country.\"She said People Before Profit had heard a lot of anger from voters while canvassing and believed that the big parties will \"take a kicking in this election\".

'Smartphones conscripted in cancer fight Scientists are calling on Android phone owners to donate some of their processing power to help in the fight against childhood cancers. The spare computing power of Android devices and computers can be utilised to work out which compounds can best fight cancer cells. The work is part of a wider citizen science project, set up by IBM. In order to help, users need to. The World Community Grid was set up by IBM in 2004, and since then more than 700, 000 volunteers have helped researchers process complex computations, including ones to better understand Ebola, Zika, tuberculosis and HIV Aids. Initially it utilised the processing power of computers but a few years ago added an Android app to its arsenal. Now it is working with the Smash Childhood Cancer project to help find cures for six types of childhood cancer, including brain tumours, cancer of the liver and bone cancer.\"The app only runs when you have 90\% charge and it waits until you are connected to wi-fi so it does not use up data. It has been designed to stay out of the way and be non-intrusive,\" said Juan Hindo, program manager of IBM Corporate Citizenship. She explained that researchers looking for the best cures for a range of childhood cancers needed to run simulation tools to predict how a compound would perform to prevent disease. Virtual super-computer \"You need a lot of computer power to do this and researchers may only be able to access a supercomputer at certain times and, to test each one, they need to run millions of simulations,\" said Ms Hindo. Conducting research on this scale in a laboratory is nearly impossible because of the amount of time and expense involved.\"When you have spare computing power the app requests one of the calculations and if the person, for instance, starts to watch a video, it will pause. When it is done, it sends it back to the community grid,\" she said. Ms Hindo estimates that, on average the system performs between one to two million calculations each day. The system has previously been used to pinpoint the compounds that cause neuroblastoma, one of the most prevalent childhood cancers - 200, 000 volunteers contributed to that experiment, which helped identify several potential treatments.\"For researchers, it gives them access to a virtual super-computer which allows them to think big, and for volunteers it invites the general public to play a role in scientific discovery,\" said Ms Hindo. The system is currently not available for iOS, due to developer rules that govern how apps run on the Apple platform. It is free for scientists to use but they must make the results publicly available for other researchers to access and use.',tech
'Norwich City: Manager Alex Neil sacked by Championship club Norwich City have sacked manager Alex Neil after just over two years in charge at the Championship club. Neil, 35, helped the Canaries earn promotion to the Premier League after joining the club in January 2015, but they suffered relegation last season. City had failed to win in five games under the former Hamilton boss, leaving them nine points outside the top six. First-team coach Alan Irvine will take charge of the team for Saturday\'s game with relegation-threatened Blackburn. A said: \"The board has taken the tough but unanimous decision, believing it is in the best interests of the club for a new manager to be in place through a crucial summer transfer window.\" Norwich were second in October, but have won just seven of their last 24 Championship games and dropped to eighth.

'Pearson boss sees pay boost despite firm\'s struggles The boss of publisher Pearson saw his pay package rise 20\% last year despite the firm sliding to a record loss. John Fallon made £1. 5m in 2016, including a £343, 000 bonus, as the company hit certain performance measures. Pearson met its operating profit target of £630m, but made a £2. 6bn pre-tax loss after writing down its US assets. At the start of 2016, Pearson and also lowered its profit forecast. Pearson, the former owner of the Financial Times, said Mr Fallon\'s basic salary was frozen and would remain so in 2017. News of the pay award drew criticism from the Institute of Directors and a high pay campaign group. Bonus policy A Pearson spokesman said the board had decided Mr Fallon would \"receive a limited bonus, in line with the company\'s broader bonus policy\". The bonus reflected Pearson achieving its 2016 profit guidance, as well as \"delivering strong operating cash flow, and delivering a major restructuring successfully\". Mr Fallon will also re-invest his bonus in shares in the company, the spokesman said. Under Mr Fallon\'s leadership, Pearson has sold its stakes in the Financial Times and the Economist to focus on educational publishing. However, a slowdown in business from US college students has hampered growth. In January 2017, the firm was forced to for this year in its fifth profit warning since Mr Fallon took over in 2013. It also put its stake in book publisher Penguin Random House up for sale. Pearson\'s shares dropped to a seven-year low after the profit warning in January and are yet to recover much ground.\"Publishers are struggling. Print media is in a very difficult situation at the moment and that\'s not Pearson\'s fault,\" said Oliver Parry, head of corporate governance at business lobby group, the Institute of Directors.\'Wrong message\' However, Mr Parry also said companies like Pearson needed to show \"common sense\" about their pay policies.\"It seems to be one rule for one sector of people and another for others as shown here by the job cuts,\" he said. The pay rise for Pearson\'s boss comes just weeks after the chief executives of UK firms Shell and Rolls-Royce received pay boosts despite profits falling last year. UK companies are holding major votes on pay policies in the coming months, and such wage rises risked sending the wrong message, Mr Parry said.\"My concern here is not for Pearson, but the damage it does to British business as a whole as we enter AGM [annual general meeting] season,\" he said. The High Pay Centre, which campaigns against the disparity between executive and workers\' pay, said Mr Fallon\'s pay rise showed how the current system was broken. \"What\'s difficult to take for employees, former employees and some investors is you can get the kind of performance Pearson has given and the chief executive still gets a pretty hefty pay rise,\" said Stefan Stern of the High Pay Centre.',business
'Liverpool to reimagine The Beatles\' Sgt Pepper in eclectic arts festival Liverpool is marking the 50th birthday of The Beatles\' Sgt Pepper album by asking a dizzying array of performers to reinterpret the songs in the city. From choirs to cabaret performers and musicians to artists, each will stage an event inspired by a different track. The album - released on 1 June 1967 - regularly comes towards the top of lists of the greatest albums ever made. The Liverpool festival takes place in May and June and is split into two halves - one for each side of the LP. Side one Side two The first event - based on the first track -will act as an \"overture\" and will take place from 25-27 May, with the rest of side one being staged from 1-5 June. Side two will take place from 8-11 June - except A Day in the Life, which will be the finale on 16 June.\'Celebrating the city\' Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said the festival would be \"thought-provoking, sometimes cheeky and always entertaining\". At the event\'s launch on Wednesday, he said: \"We\'re not about wrapping The Beatles\' heritage in aspic or, if you like, turning The Beatles into a Disney-style theme park.\"But we have to celebrate the place, the city, that gave them their inspiration and helped them write their fantastic work.\" Jeremy Deller said one of his works will be about Brian Epstein in the year of the 50th anniversary of The Beatles manager\'s death. Details of his second work are under wraps.\"Every project has its own challenges but it\'s a record I\'ve lived with and I know The Beatles inside out - or I feel I do. I\'ve studied them,\" Deller said.\"It\'s almost like a religion, isn\'t it, popular music, and The Beatles are at the apex of that. So I feel I have an inside take on it.\"He added: \"I think it\'s important it doesn\'t become a big nostalgia festival really. I don\'t mind nostalgia, but the festival has to be about more than just The Beatles - it has to be about Liverpool as it is now and the future of Liverpool to have any meaning for the public.\" ',entertainment
'MP: Christians shouldn’t feel embarrassed about display of faith MP Carol Monaghan says she was not embarrassed about her decision to appear at a Commons select committee meeting with a cross on her forehead on Ash Wednesday. The SNP MP for Glasgow North West said: \"The reaction was generally positive, most people didn\'t know what it meant.\"When I came into committee, one of the members asked me about it. I said \'it\'s Ash Wednesday\' and they said \'but this is going to be broadcast\'.\"I think they just thought I didn\'t want to be embarrassed - but I was not going to rub it off.\"Many religions have visible symbols and Christians should not feel any embarrassment in either practising their religion or in the public display of religious symbols.\" Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent and many Christians attend a church service at which their foreheads are marked with ash in the shape of a cross. The crosses are made from a mix of ashes - often from burnt palm leaves - and holy water and signify the worshipper\'s repentance before God.\'Source of conversation\' Ms Monaghan says she got the \"usual\" reaction, including people pointing out that she had a mark on her forehead. It is something she is used to having been a science teacher in a non-denominational comprehensive school before becoming an MP in 2015.\"I am happy to answer their questions. For me it is an educational opportunity,\" she said. The Church of England says it encourages members to go out on the streets to bring this centuries-old tradition to the wider public. Members of Croydon Minster spoke to commuters at the local tram station, offering what they dubbed \"Ash n\' Dash\". In Galway, a drive-thru Ash Wednesday service was described as \"beautiful and overwhelmingly respectful\". For Christians, Lent is a season of reflection and preparation before Easter, marking Jesus\'s 40 days of fasting in the desert. Many attempt to fast, or give up something for the 40 days - such as Prime Minister Theresa May, who will stop eating crisps. On Ash Wednesday, Christians are encouraged not to rub the ashes off their foreheads and many display the symbol at work, like Ms Monaghan. A spokeswoman for the Catholic Church in England and Wales says: \"Keeping the ashes on one\'s forehead throughout the day acts as a sign of the cross to all we meet and can often be a source of conversation.\"Many people are dimly aware of ashes and the season of Lent - this visible witness could awaken faith in the hearts of others in the way that words cannot.\"But are Christians allowed to display the religious symbol while at work? Claire Dawson, employment lawyer at Slater and Gordon, says the right to display a religious symbol is protected under employment law and the European Convention on Human Rights, unless there is a good justification for prohibiting it. She says: \"If it was questioned by an employer or prohibited then they would have to have a good reason for that.\"If you are someone who is a TV presenter, for example, there may be more of a debate.\"The type of justification which is taken seriously would be health and safety.\"There has been a case where somebody was fighting for her right to wear a cross at work, but because she was a nurse, it was against the employer\'s health and safety policy which justified her not being allowed to wear it.\"Whereas a woman who was British Airways ground crew and who wanted to wear a cross, although it didn\'t comply with BA\'s dress code and corporate image, that wasn\'t considered important enough to trump her religion.\"\'Conscious decision\' In addition, she says, employees are protected from being treated less favourably because of their religion or belief and from being subjected to harassment because of it. Ms Monaghan said that one of the Commons doorkeepers at Prime Minister\'s Questions had asked her about it after seeing another MP with, as he put it, \"something on his head\". The 44-year-old mother of three said it had never been a problem for her although \"in a situation where cameras are rolling, you have to make a conscious decision\".\"I have to be open about it - for me it would be wrong to hide something which is important to me.\" ',politics

'Get Out star says Samuel L Jackson \'entitled to his opinion\' The actor at the centre of a debate about the casting of British black actors in the US has spoken about how being black has lost him roles. Daniel Kaluuya, who was born in London, leads the cast of Get Out - a searing racial satire about contemporary America. Released in the UK this week, Jordan Peele\'s horror film has already been a massive hit at the US box office, making more than $100m (£82. 5m). But the film hit the headlines last week after actor Samuel L Jackson in films about US race relations. Speaking to the BBC, Skins star Kaluuya said he was proud to be in the first lead role of his career. \"You do stuff, people make decisions and it goes out there and people have opinions. And everyone\'s entitled to their opinion,\" he said.\"I love all my black brothers and sisters worldwide, and that\'s my position.\"All I know is this my first ever lead role in a film and I\'ve lost out on a lot of roles because I\'m black.\"He added: \"It\'s my one shot. I\'m going to come through it and do my thing and go home.\"He went on to describe Jackson as a \"legend on and off screen\". In his original radio interview a week ago, Jackson said he wondered what Get Out would have been like with a US actor in the lead role. \"Daniel grew up in a country where they\'ve been interracial dating for 100 years,\" he said. Clarifying his remarks later in the week, Other actors have joined the debate, with Star Wars actor John Boyega that it was a \"conflict we don\'t have time for\". In an , Homeland actor David Harewood argued that Britons may be better suited to some parts because they are not burdened by \"what\'s in the history books\".\'Paranoid\' In Get Out, Kaluuya plays Chris, an African-American photographer who goes with his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) to visit her parents at their country home. Chris is worried because Rose has not told her family she has a black boyfriend. He initially receives a warm welcome - if a bit odd at times - but as the weekend progresses, Chris discovers Rose\'s parents have a very different agenda.\"Jordan wrote this as a response to the idea that racism was \'solved\' because Obama was president,\" Kaluuya said. Peele has admitted he had not wanted to cast a British actor, but that Kaluuya had won him over during an initial audition. \"We spoke on Skype,\" Kaluuya confirmed. \"He was very wary because it\'s an African-American specific experience, but then we had a chat about what it\'s like being black worldwide and being black in London.\"The film\'s success has made Peele the first African-American writer-director to earn $100m with his debut movie, . How much did Kaluuya identify with the film\'s themes? \"There are an uncountable amount of instances when I\'ve been paranoid,\" he said.\"I did a shoot in Lithuania when I was 17. Everywhere I went people were pointing and staring. \"Or when I go to Lidl and I get followed by security guards.

'Blair: Labour should reconsider Brexit stance Labour should be prepared to alter its stance on Brexit - and if necessary argue that Britain should stay inside the EU, Tony Blair has said. The former PM told the BBC\'s Andrew Marr that Labour should change its position if the government delivers a Brexit deal the people do not like. He urged Labour to hold ministers to account over its pledge to secure a trade deal with the EU. Labour\'s Jeremy Corbyn has said the referendum result should be respected. Mr Blair, who was Labour prime minister between 1997 and 2007, said the government faced negotiations of \"unparalleled complexity\" if it was to achieve its stated aim of delivering an agreement that replicates as closely as possible Britain\'s existing trade arrangements with the EU. While voters had backed Brexit in last year\'s referendum, he said he believed it was \"possible\" the public mood would change if it did not result in the promised benefits - and Labour should be ready to capitalise on that. Option of staying \"A few weeks ago in the House of Commons [Brexit Secretary] David Davis said they were going to deliver a deal with exactly the same benefits we now have from the single market and the customs union - we should hold them to that,\" he told the BBC.\"If they are going to try and deliver exactly the same benefits as we have now in the single market and customs union, this is an endeavour of unparalleled complexity.\" He argued that if control of EU migration is the only reason for Brexit \"it is possible - I don\'t put it higher than that - that people start to think, \'is this really the thing that is going to be important?\'\"Mr Blair said in his opinion Labour should say: \"We believed in Remain, we still think the best thing is for Britain to be part of the European Union - we acknowledge the people voted against that, we acknowledge therefore the government has a mandate to negotiate Brexit, but we are going to hold them to the test that they have set.\"And if they do not pass that test, then we are going to retain the right to represent the people of this country should their will change, to offer them the option of staying.\"',politics

Last year, MPs said it had become a \"vehicle of choice\" for spreading extremist propaganda on the internet. In Twitter\'s - which covers the period from 1 July to 31 December 2016 - it said internal measures to tackle the issue had improved.

If he shows what he can do, he will be fine. \"He\'s a massive talent.

Roberts trained with Chris Coleman\'s squad last summer before they took part in Euro 2016, their first major tournament since 1958.\"It was a massive tournament, it boosted Welsh football massively,\" he added. Roberts joined West Brom\'s academy at the age of seven, making his debut as a substitute against Liverpool in the Premier League in May 2016.\"That was a massive experience and a great joy for me and my family,\" Roberts said.\"You can\'t really put it into words.

'Dow Jones stock index hits best winning streak in 30 years The US Dow Jones stock index has closed at a record high for the 12th day running as Donald Trump promised a \"big\" infrastructure announcement. It is the longest winning streak for the share index since January 1987. Analysts said Wall Street was buoyed by hopes the US president would set out more on his spending and tax plans in a speech to Congress on Tuesday. The , one of the US\'s three main stock indexes, finished 15 points higher at 20, 837. Ahead of the speech, Mr Trump said: \"We\'re going to make it easier for states to invest in infrastructure and I\'m going to have a big statement tomorrow night on infrastructure.\" The president also said he would seek to boost defence spending by $54bn (£43bn), a 10\% rise, in his proposed budget plans for 2018. Trump bump As well as significantly raising infrastructure spending, Mr Trump has previously pledged to cut taxes for US businesses.\"For the moment, whenever he speaks of those upcoming plans, we get a leg up in the market,\" Peter Jankovskis, director of research at Oakbrook Investments, told BBC World Service.\"Whenever he\'s not talking, there\'s enough momentum to keep it moving forward.\"The index also edged two points higher to 2, 370, while the tech-focused index rose 17 points to 5, 862. The biggest winners were shares in energy, financial and healthcare firms - areas that stand to gain if Mr Trump\'s policies spur faster economic growth, Mr Jankovskis said.

'Sir Howard Hodgkin: Turner winner who \'hated painting\' dies at 84 British artist Sir Howard Hodgkin has died at the age of 84. The Turner Prize-winner was well known for saying in interviews how much he hated painting.\"People have often said to me, \'aren\'t you lucky to be able to do this for a living\' and I say no, thank you, I\'m not lucky,\" he told the BBC in 2014.\"I may be lucky with the result but to go through the horrors of painting pictures is not something I ever look forward to.\"So why did he carry on? \"It\'s what I do. I have no other skills. [But] it\'s always been agony,\" he explained to the . The abstract painter and printmaker, who died in hospital in London on Thursday, was \"a central figure in contemporary art for over half a century\", Tate galleries said. Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota said he was \"one of the great artists and colourists of his generation\". Sir Howard won the Turner Prize in 1985 and represented the UK at the Venice Biennale the previous year. He was knighted in 1992. Analysis Sir Howard Hodgkin was an important artist whose use of colour and memory gave his largely abstract works great potency. He didn\'t leave you looking, as some do, for the art in his art - it was there, on the canvas, to see and be seen: immediate and memorable. For me, he took the essence of Matisse and Degas, mixed it with European abstraction and Indian light to conjure up, through his own unique talents, beautiful, sensitive images. His work is held by major galleries and museums around the world, including the British Museum, Tate and MoMA in New York, and two exhibitions of his work are opening in the UK in the coming months. Sir Nicholas said: \"His sensuous, intense paintings were infused with his love and understanding of late 19th-Century French painting, especially Degas, Vuillard and Bonnard, and by his feeling for the heat and colours of India, which he visited on many occasions. \"His characteristic subject, the memory of a meeting or a conversation with a friend, resulted in paintings that radiate the emotions of life: love, anger, vanity, beauty and companionship.\" Sir Nicholas added that over the past 30 years, the artist\'s international standing has grown, with key exhibitions in Europe and the US. as \"one of the painters of our generation - who gave us emotion in the form of colour.\" Paul Moorhouse, 20th Century curator at the National Portrait Gallery, said: \"Howard is probably one of the truly great British artists of the last 60 years - a really distinctive voice, someone with his own artistic identity, someone who has really extended our understanding of the way artists represent the world.\"His death comes days before the National Portrait Gallery opens the first exhibition of portraits by the artist. Howard Hodgkin: Absent Friends features more than 50 works, dating from 1949 to the present. His portraits include those of fellow artists David Hockney, Patrick Caulfield and RB Kitaj. India inspiration Works he produced on his latest visit to India are to go on display at The Hepworth Wakefield in Howard Hodgkin: Painting India, which opens in June. Simon Wallis, director of the gallery, said the Hepworth was \"deeply saddened\" by news of his death, adding: \"He was one of the most important artists of our time. \"We are enormously grateful for Howard\'s generosity with his time and his enthusiasm. We are proud to be realising an exhibition about the influence of India on his work, a place that he was so passionate about, and from which he drew such inspiration throughout his life.\" At the time the exhibition was announced, Sir Howard said he was \"excited\" by the idea of it, adding of his work: \"I fell in love with Indian art when I was at school, thanks to the enterprising art master, Wilfrid Blunt. \"I longed to visit India, but only managed to do so in my early 20s. It proved a revelation. It changed my way of thinking and, probably, the way I paint.\" Sir Howard also designed one of 12 posters for the London 2012 Games. His poster, called Swimming, featured a figure swimming through the water. Gordon Howard Eliot Hodgkin was born on 6 August in Hammersmith, London, in 1932. In 1940 he was evacuated with mother and older sister, Ann, to the US where they lived on Long Island. He first decided he wanted to become an artist aged just five, and was inspired by seeing the works Stuart Davis, Matisse and Picasso at Manhattan\'s Museum of Modern Art. When he returned to the UK he ran away from school to become an artist. In 1952, he had his first show in a public gallery at the Victoria Art Gallery in Bath. He later studied at the Camberwell School of Art and then Bath Academy of Art, where he went on to teach, and was a trustee of the Tate and National Gallery. \'Lonely occupation\' he said he had had a hard road to recognition in the UK, describing it as \"enemy territory\" for painters. Sir Howard had told the BBC in a 2012 interview that he was looking towards the end of his life, adding: \"Death is always hovering in the distance. I want to get out as much as I can.\" And last year, he told the Daily Telegraph being a painter was a \"lonely occupation\", adding: \"I don\'t consider myself successful. Being well-known or having lots of exhibitions has nothing to do with being an artist - those things are just chance.\"',entertainment
'Ruth Davidson: \'Scots do not want a referendum\' The Scottish Conservative leader has said the majority of Scots do not want a second independence referendum. Ruth Davidson told the BBC\'s Andrew Marr Show that Nicola Sturgeon\'s call for such a vote was \"not the will of the Scottish people\". She said: \"The SNP is not Scotland, they are acting against the majority wishes of the people of Scotland.\" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish voters had the right to a choice on the country\'s futureMs Davidson was speaking six days after Scotland\'s first minister announced she wished to hold another independence referendum in autumn 2018 or spring 2019 once the terms of the UK\'s Brexit deal \"became known\". Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish voters should then be given a choice about the country\'s future direction. But Ms Davidson cited recent opinion polls suggesting that a majority of Scots do not want another referendum to take place in the next few years. She said: \"I don\'t think you can have an independence referendum again if you don\'t have public consent for it, and the people of Scotland don\'t want this. \"We see another poll today, to add to the many dozen that we\'ve seen since June of last year, that show that the majority of people in Scotland don\'t want this.\" Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated that the UK government will refuse to allow another referendum in the SNP\'s preferred timescale, arguing that \"now is not the time\" with Brexit negotiations due to start shortly. Ms Davidson said: \"There are people right across Scotland, many, many thousands of them, that are so thankful for the prime minister to say let\'s take a pause on this.\"She also said it was \"astonishing\" that the SNP had not given more details of its independence plan during its spring conference in Aberdeen.\"We have asked basic questions on things like currency, on things like a central bank, on things like whether we would even rejoin Europe as a full member, and Nicola Sturgeon seems unable to commit to that,\" she said. Timescale negotiations The SNP\'s 2016 manifesto said the Scottish Parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there was \"a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\". Scottish voters backed remaining in the EU by 62\% to 38\% in the Brexit vote last June. Nicola Sturgeon insisted Scottish voters had the right to make a choice on the country\'s future \"when the terms of Brexit are clear but before it\'s too late\". Speaking on ITV\'s Peston programme, she said her preferred timescale for an independence vote could change if the Brexit negotiations took longer than expected but insisted it would be \"unreasonable\" to push it as far back as 2021. She said: \"If she\'s [Theresa May] talking in the spring of 2019, a bit later perhaps than I was suggesting, there may be some room for discussion around that.\"But it seems to me to be just fundamentally unfair for a UK government, with Brexit having sunk the ship, trying to puncture Scotland\'s lifeboat as well.\"\'Change is coming\' She said her suggested timing was based on comments by Theresa May and Brexit Secretary David Davis about the likely timetable for the Brexit process.\"Change is coming. This is about having a choice over the type of change and I think we should have that choice before Scotland is taken out of the EU and a long period of time elapses, making it much harder for Scotland to try to negotiate a different relationship with Europe,\" she said. Asked if she wanted an independent Scotland to be a full member of the European Union, she said: \"The minimum for Scotland is to be within the single market, it\'s what I think makes sense for the UK as well if it\'s out of the EU - but my preference is for an independent Scotland to be in the EU.\"The Scottish Parliament will debate the issue of a new referendum on Tuesday and Wednesday. While the SNP does not have an overall majority, the Scottish Greens have said they will back the the transfer of powers from Westminster that would allow such a vote to be held. Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie said his party\'s position on that issue was decided at its conference in October. He was challenged on the BBC\'s Sunday Politics Scotland programme on whether his party had a mandate for a second referendum as its 2016 manifesto said a new vote should \"come about by the will of the people\". He said: \"A political party in opposition obviously has to look at its policy in terms of what is happening around the world and in June last year the world changed around us.\"Our political party debated how we should respond to this. Our members voted in favour of a motion... calling for a Section 30 order.\"',politics
'McDonald\'s India delivery app \'leaks user data\' McDonald\'s delivery app in India leaked personal information about 2. 2 million users, a security firm has found. A poorly configured server gave anyone access to the names, emails, home addresses and phone numbers of users, Sending a simple request to the server produced lots of information about users, it said. McDonald\'s India said it had fixed the app and urged users to install the updated version. No penalty The McDelivery app is operated by Westlife Development which oversees McDonald\'s restaurants in south and west India. McDonald\'s India said the app did not store any \"sensitive financial data\" such as credit card numbers, passwords or bank account details. \"The website and app have always been safe to use and we update security measures on a regular basis,\" it told the newspaper. Fallible said it had checked after the app was updated and found that it was still leaking information, but gave no details about the extent of this leak. It added that it had told McDonald\'s about the more recent problem it discovered and was awaiting a second response. One app user is believed to have already started legal action over the leaky server, Security firm Fallible said that the lack of strong data protection laws in India and the absence of any meaningful penalty for leaking data meant many companies did little to protect user data. It claimed to have uncovered \"more than 50\" instances of data leaks at Indian firms.\"We are pleasantly surprised when we find Indian companies without a personal or payment data leak vulnerability,\" it said.

'State of Sport: British athlete care must improve - Tanni Grey-Thompson British Olympic and Paralympic sport must improve its athletes\' welfare, says Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson. The 11-time Paralympic gold medallist has authored a forthcoming report into the subject, which has been brought into sharp focus by recent claims. British Swimming is the latest body to investigate claims of while several ex-riders have spoken of a at British Cycling. \"We must prove we can win medals with a duty of care,\" Grey-Thompson said. Speaking at a debate organised by the BBC as part of its State of Sport coverage, she added: \"We\'ve proved we can win medals. I don\'t think having a duty of care diminishes our chances of winning.\"We can\'t make it all warm and cuddly - because that is not what elite sport is. But it is about getting the best talent and not leaving athletes broken at the end of it.\"Grey-Thompson\'s report - due for publication \"imminently\", she said - was commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. \"There are some really good sports out there; there are sports that need to do much more,\" she added. \"My report doesn\'t mention a sport in particular, it doesn\'t mention a particular person in it. It\'s about the principles of how sport should be as we go forward.\"On Thursday, became the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward with criticisms of British Cycling\'s World Class programme - following Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley. Houvenaghel said a \"medal at any cost\" approach created a \"culture of fear\" at the organisation, which she accused of \"ageism\" and having \"zero regard\" for her welfare. Later on Thursday, BBC sports editor Dan Roan exclusively reported on British Swimming\'s investigation into made by Paralympians about a coach. Swimming was Britain\'s most successful sport at the Rio Paralympics. The British team won 47 medals - 16 golds of 152 available - and set eight world records. \'A wake-up call for sport in Britain\' Also speaking at Friday\'s debate, UK Sport chief executive Liz Nichol described the athletes\' testimonies as \"a wake-up call for sport\".\"We have to be much more aware of responsibilities, beyond the responsibility of helping athletes achieve what they all aspire to,\" she said\"It\'s clear it can be better, and it will be better. This is a big step-up for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics cycle.\"UK Sport is the funding body for Olympic and Paralympic sports in Britain. When Nichol was asked whether linking funding to medal targets might have a negative effect on athlete welfare, she replied: \"We don\'t reward success, we invest in potential. Speaking about British Cycling\'s response to failures identified in a leaked draft report into its World Class Programme, Nichol added: \"This is something that is very significant. \"Every sport can learn from it and every sport should be looking at the cycling plan and checking to see if they are doing things properly.\"Yes it is uncomfortable, but it is right that athletes are speaking out. And it is right that we all acknowledge that something has got to change - and it will change - over this next cycle.\" \'It\'s not an issue of welfare or medals\' Helen Richardson-Walsh, who starred as Great Britain won Olympic hockey gold in Rio, said she had seen \"big changes\" in athlete welfare over her career. \"Gone are the days where you would get shouted at on the sideline at international level. I don\'t think that\'s acceptable in society any more and it is kind of being phased out in sport,\" the 35-year-old said. \"What we developed as a team in the last two Olympic cycles was so far removed from that old fashioned in your face coaching and we were more successful.\"You don\'t need to go down that route to win.

'Robots to affect up to 30\% of UK jobs, says PwC Robotics and artificial intelligence could affect almost a third of UK jobs by the 2030s, according to a study. However, the report from accountancy firm PwC also predicted that the nature of some occupations would change rather than disappear. It added that automation could create more wealth and additional jobs elsewhere in the economy. Jobs in manufacturing and retail were among the most at risk from the new technologies, the report said. The study estimated that 30\% of existing jobs in the UK were potentially at a high risk of automation, compared with 38\% in the US, 35\% in Germany and 21\% in Japan. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, told the BBC that \"more manual, routine jobs\" which \"can effectively be programmed\" were the most at risk.\"Jobs where you\'ve got more of a human touch, like health and education,\" would be safer, he said. Under threat The use of robots in the workplace is rising with workers in some sectors already facing up to the potential challenges.\"You can already see on the railways that all these strikes are not unrelated to the move towards driverless trains,\" Mr Hawksworth said. In the future, truck drivers might \"job share\" with a self-driving lorry, although even that might ultimately be under threat, he said.\"Ultimately, people are going to have to be more adaptable,\" he added. The government should help by providing lower-skill workers with more training in the next 10 to 20 years, the report said. However, it also concluded that gains in productivity from robots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) would boost the economy.\"In many ways automation is a good thing. It\'s going to boost productivity, a big problem for the UK recently, and increase incomes... which will increase demand for human jobs in other areas,\" Mr Hawksworth said. The UK is near record-low levels of unemployment and so outsourcing more repetitive tasks to robots could free up people to do more valuable work, the report found. Which jobs are most at risk? Transportation and storage - 56\% of jobs at high risk from automationManufacturing - 46\%Wholesale and retail trade - 44\%Administrative and support services - 37\%Financial and insurance - 32\%Professional, scientific and technical - 26\%Construction - 24\%Arts and entertainment - 22\%Agriculture, forestry and fishing - 19\%Human health and social work - 17\%Education - 9\%',business
'Maren Morris: From Grammy Camp to Grammy winner This time last year, Maren Morris was a relative unknown, playing a side stage at London\'s Country 2 Country festival. Then something unexpected happened.\"My single My Church hadn\'t been out for very long,\" she recalls. \"But the crowd already knew all the words.\"That was the first documented \'wow\' moment for me, hearing that whole crowd sing it back to me.\"Fast forward 12 months and Morris is one of country music\'s biggest new stars. She was named best new artist at the Country Music Awards, won best country song at the Grammys, played on Saturday Night Live and staged her first ever tour. \"Everything took off a little bit faster than we had imagined,\" she marvels. \"It\'s been turbo-speed.\" This weekend, the 26-year-old returns to Country 2 Country - this time on the main stage. As she warms up for the show, she tells the BBC about the last 12, dizzying months; having a day named in her honour; and how she was trained for success at something called \"Grammy Camp\". Oh yeah, it\'s very gratifying! It means someone loves my song enough to work it up for their audition. That\'s very cool. But I\'m honestly so thankful that I didn\'t make it onto any of those shows. There\'s just so many of them now. I think The Voice is on season 40 already. Oh, it\'s still weird. I\'m still reeling. It just felt like such a triumph because it was my first try - my first album on a major label. No-one can describe it, your first Grammy. It\'s something you practice in the mirror when you\'re seven years old but when you get to that day, there\'s so many emotions, so many people around you. It\'s hard to articulate but it\'s just the most amazing feeling. Yeah, I\'ve always been inspired by music and healed by it. It seemed natural to write a song about my love for it. Yeah - I was at a weird emotional crossroads. I\'d had a little luck in the songwriting world [Morris wrote songs for Kelly Clarkson and Tim McGraw] but I wasn\'t getting my songs on the radio, so I went on this writing trip to LA and wrote my heart out. Then I was driving around one day, and I remember being really struck by seeing the ocean. A song came on the radio - and I don\'t remember which one - but I thought to myself, \"this really is a church to me\". It\'s amazing how a song, even just a couple of seconds of a song, can change your mood. So I wrote the title down, My Church, and brought it to my co-writer Busbee the next day. It\'s monumental! You\'re just driving around and it randomly comes on. You can\'t prepare for it, and I certainly wasn\'t ready. I was driving around Nashville and it was snowing, then I heard the first few chords and had to pull over, because I was so overcome with emotion. It\'s kind of ironic that I had to pull over when the song is about driving and listening to music! It was 2005 and the Grammy Foundation flew high school kids from across the country to LA for a week for all these seminars. It was really cool - we got to work with top writers and listen to people like Jimmy Jam [producer for Janet and Michael Jackson] and David Foster [Madonna, Michael Buble talk about their career. It was just like Disney World for a music freak. Any time they ask, I\'ll be up for it because it left such a big impression on me. For the first time, I was surrounded by kids my age that were interested in the same things I was. That\'s why I\'m so passionate about music education, especially in public schools. It\'s very sad. I went to a pretty run-down high school and there was no funding for arts - so now I give all the proceeds from the \"meet and greet\" tickets on my tour to my high school fine arts programme. My job now is just to give back to things I\'m interested in, and that\'s a big one. I look up to a lot of female songwriters. I love Dolly Parton, I love Patty Griffin and I\'ve always loved Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash and Elton John. They\'re all storytellers. That\'s why I grew up loving country. It\'s all so honest and story-based and the lyrics are poetic, but they\'re structured so well. It\'s really airtight writing but I love it in a soulful way, too, because it\'s such a truth-telling genre. She did! That one didn\'t last very long. I won\'t take credit and say it\'s because of my song, but I would like to think I sometimes have good advice to give. Not in those exact terms, but I remember having a glass of wine with my friend and hearing her go on and on about the guy for the thousandth time. I was like, \"Come , you\'re way too good for this guy.\" The next day, I was telling my co-writers about the whole thing. I wasn\'t aiming for a song, I was just complaining - but Luke Laird just started playing that chord progression and singing the hook. It\'s from a song called I Wish I Was, which I wrote when I went through this very major break-up. I was the breaker in that relationship, so the lyric is \"I\'m not the hero in this story\". But a lot of things changed from the day I wrote that song. I got through the break-up, grew up, stopped being so selfish and became more aware of people\'s feelings. And I think, in a way, I became the good guy over the course of those years. So I thought it would be cool to take a word from a song where I\'m the villain and say that, over the course of making this album, I sort of became my own hero, in a roundabout way. I guess?! That was hilarious. It happened at my parents\' hair salon - the mayor came and he handed me this plaque. But one of my best friends has her birthday on 27 December. I was like, \"Sorry, Skylar, it\'s Maren Morris day. Your birthday can wait \'til tomorrow.\"Totally. I can do that. I think I have that power now. ',entertainment

He accused the PM of pursuing the same \"aggressive, nationalistic\" agenda as Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. He told his party\'s conference Theresa May is \"to blame\" for every job that is lost as a result of Brexit. His party is the \"real opposition\" to her \"hard Brexit\" plan, he added. Mrs May that she wanted a \"more united\" Britain. But in a keynote address to his supporters in York, Mr Farron said Mrs May was part of an \"emerging consensus\" on the political right, characterised by nationalism, authoritarianism and protectionism, committed to reversing human rights and indifferent to, or in denial of, climate change.\'Taken for granted\'? \"The politics of Trump.

'Twitter considers paid membership option Twitter is considering adding a paid membership option for businesses and power users. The micro-blogging service, which has struggled to grow its user base in recent years, is carrying out surveys to “assess interest” in the idea. Paying members would get access to an enhanced version of Tweetdeck, Twitter’s souped-up interface that offers more functionality than Twitter. com. The company has not made any indication it is considering charging regular users of the service. But a premium membership scheme could offer Twitter a new revenue stream at a time when users are increasingly turning to other networks such as Snapchat. Twitter’s active user base has plateaued - and advertising revenues, currently the firms only meaningful income stream, are in decline. Twitter’s struggles come despite the online advertising market growing considerably in the past year. Twitter has surveyed a small selection of its users about the idea. In a statement, the company said: \"We regularly conduct user research to gather feedback about people’s Twitter experience and to better inform our product investment decisions, and we\'re exploring several ways to make Tweetdeck even more valuable for professionals.” In an email to selected users, the company described how the new tool would work. \"This premium tool set will provide valuable viewing, posting, and signaling tools like alerts, trends and activity analysis, advanced analytics, and composing and posting tools all in one customizable dashboard,” the note said. \"It will be designed to make it easier than ever to keep up with multiple interests, grow your audience, and see even more great content and information in real-time.” If it goes ahead with premium accounts, Twitter will be competing with more established players like SocialFlow and HootSuite - companies that have offered enhanced ways to use Twitter for many years. Why it has taken the company this long to roll out its own initiative is not clear. In 2009, co-founder Biz Stone said the firm had hired a product manager to develop premium features, but these never materialised - and Mr Stone left the company in 2011. ',tech

We know about what it takes to win, we know what the experience is like, the pressures, and it\'s more a case of us trusting our technique and our game plan.\"Team Murdoch have had a mixed season but have found form at the right time, last month in Perth to seal their place at the worlds.\"That\'s always been our goal for the season, to peak at the right time, and we certainly did that with winning the Scottish Championships,\" Murdoch added. \"So now we\'ve had a great few weeks of training and we\'re ready to go to Canada.\" Murdoch had to watch Tom Brewster\'s rival rink represent Scotland at the last world championships and last year\'s home European Championships. He admits missing out on those events gave him added incentive this year - as did the thought of competing at the Olympic Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, in February. Having won a silver medal at the Sochi Olympics in 2014, making it to South Korea is a huge target. A top seven finish at the worlds will secure Great Britain a men\'s quota place for PyeongChang, and a medal in Canada will strengthen Murdoch\'s rink\'s case for Olympic selection. \"We\'ve always had the hunger and the drive and we\'ve always had the Olympics as the goal at the end, that\'s still the end goal,\" Murdoch said. \"We\'ve got a lot of work to do to achieve that. A lot of things go hand in hand in that week, but ultimately it\'s about doing well and getting a medal at the worlds. For us there\'s a lot of good challenges and I think that\'s what motivates you.\"Murdoch is also relishing a return to Canada and the spotlight that comes with competing in a country where curling is big news. Team Murdoch regularly play there during the season, with events often shown live on TV.\"It\'s in Canada so it\'ll be huge crowds and a massive arena,\" he said. \"It\'s quite strange for us coming home where nobody knows us, but out there everyone knows us. It\'s such a popular sport and it\'s starting to get a really big following over there, so it\'s an exciting place to go and compete.\" Joining Team Murdoch for these championships is someone who would normally be lining up for a rival rink. Ross Paterson usually plays second as part of Team Brewster, but he has been poached as fifth alternate for Murdoch\'s rink.\"We\'re part of British Curling first and foremost.\" Paterson told BBC Scotland. \"Last year when we (Team Brewster) qualified we asked Scott (Andrews) to come with us as fifth man. I\'ve played with David in the past and we see each other in the gym during the week, during practice, so it\'s not a problem fitting in. I\'m looking forward to it.\"This is my first major championship as a fifth man, I was fifth man for the university games back in 2007 and I didn\'t play then, so I\'ve kind of got an idea of what you\'re doing. I\'ve still got an important job to do in terms of supporting the team and if the situation arises where I do play then I have to be ready, so it\'s a slightly different focus.\"The men\'s world curling championships take place between 1 April and 9 April.',sport
'Jones Bootmaker sale saves 840 jobs The bulk of footwear chain Jones Bootmaker has been sold to investment firm Endless, saving 72 stores and 840 jobs. However, the remaining 31 stores will close and about 260 jobs are expected to be lost. Jones was owned by Alteri Investors, whose \"value\" shoe chain Brantano collapsed earlier this week. Endless bought the profitable parts of the business under a \"pre-pack\" administration deal. Under a pre-pack agreement, a buyer for a firm or its profitable assets is lined up in advance of the administrators being called in. \"We are delighted that we have been able to rescue such an iconic UK footwear brand as Jones Bootmaker, including a high proportion of stores and preserving a large number of jobs, especially given the current economic pressures faced by retailers across the UK,\" said Will Wright, partner at KPMG and joint administrator.\"This deal recognises the value of Jones as a strong and popular High Street brand with a loyal customer base.\"Alteri Investors acquired Jones Bootmaker and Brantano in October 2015. About four months later, Brantano went into administration and Alteri bought it back, minus a few stores. The chain subsequently faced \"difficult trading conditions\", and was put into administration on Wednesday after Alteri failed to find a buyer. A pre-pack administration is one in which the insolvent company has already lined up a buyer for its profitable assets before it enters administration, allowing a sale within days It allows a firm to write off its debts and helps it close down loss-making parts of the business Critics say pre-packs \"stitch up\" unsecured creditors and can allow directors to shed liabilities and buy back the business (under a new company) Others say that if a firm is by definition insolvent, unsecured creditors are unlikely to get their money back anyway, and that pre-packs allow for a quick rescue of the business and help secure jobs ',business
'Bill Paxton, actor known for Aliens and Titanic, dies aged 61 Actor Bill Paxton, who was best known for his role in the sci-fi classic Aliens, has died at the age of 61, US media report. Paxton had reportedly suffered from complications following surgery. The Texan actor\'s biggest hits included The Terminator, Apollo 13, True Lies, Titanic, and 1996\'s Twister - in which he starred opposite Helen Hunt. He is survived by his wife of 30 years, Louise Newbury, and their two children. Paxton won an Emmy for his performance in the TV mini-series Hatfields and McCoys, alongside Kevin Costner. He also earned three Best Actor Golden Globe nominations for his starring role in the HBO drama Big Love, where he played a suburban polygamist juggling three wives and families. At the time of his death, he was working on a crime thriller TV series - Training Day - for the US network CBS. He played a morally dubious LAPD officer, Detective Frank Rourke. Fellow Hollywood stars were quick to pay tribute to Paxton as news of his death spread - among them West Wing actor Rob Lowe. He wrote on Twitter: \"Devastated by the sudden loss of my close friend and one of the finest actors in the business, Bill Paxton. Renaissance man, raconteur and uniquely American national treasure. His filmography speaks for itself. His friendship was a blessing. My love to Bunny, James and Lydia.\"In his memory, on this Oscar Sunday, watch One False Move or A Simple Plan to see this lovely leading man, at his finest.\"Cary Elwes, his co-star in Twister, shared a picture of the pair together and praised his \"talent, enthusiasm and energy\".

'Dubs amendment: Child migrant challenge defeated by MPs A move to require councils in England to identify whether they have spare capacity to house unaccompanied child refugees has been rejected by MPs. Conservative Heidi Allen said ministers had not consulted properly with local authorities when opting to close the Dubs resettlement scheme this month. But MPs voted against her amendment by 287 votes to 267. The Home Office said it encouraged councils to come forward if they had capacity for child asylum seekers. Only three Tory MPs voted in favour of the amendment: Ms Allen, Tania Mathias and Nicky Morgan. They were joined by 195 Labour MPs, 47 SNP, and nine Liberal Democrats, among others. A total of 282 Tory MPs voted against. Campaigners want 3, 000 Syrian and other children in Europe to be found homes. They said ministers have failed to live up to their commitment to do all they can to help the victims of the civil war in Syria and other conflicts when agreeing to take an unspecified number of children under a scheme named after Labour peer Lord Dubs. When the scheme closes later this month, the government expects 350 children to have been given sanctuary in the UK - in addition to those already accepted under other resettlement and asylum programmes.\'Heartless and heartbreaking\' Ministers have said councils, which are under extreme financial constraints, do not have the capacity to take the number mooted by campaigners. They have also long expressed concerns that taking children directly from southern Europe and the Balkans encourages child trafficking and potentially fatal journeys across the Mediterranean - a claim contested by charities. A cross-party group of MPs had hoped to amend the Children and Social Work Bill currently before Parliament to place a statutory duty on councils to consult and report back to ministers at least once a year on their capacity to provide safeguarding and welfare services to children, including refugees from abroad. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said she was \"deeply disappointed\" by the vote\'s result. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: \"To not help vulnerable children in need is utterly heartless and heartbreaking.\"This vote shames Britain. The government continues to defend the indefensible by closing Dubs against opposition from a significant number of MPs, including those on its own benches, and from the public.\"Lord Dubs, who arrived in Britain as a refugee from Nazism, said he was \"disappointed\", but insisted: \"The campaign isn\'t over, our better nature will surely carry the day.\" Citizens UK has claimed there are at least 368 spaces available for children in the UK under the terms of the national transfer scheme for asylum-seekers. The charity said it was \"devastated\" by the vote, but added that their campaign \"doesn\'t end here\". Children\'s charity Unicef said it was \"hugely disappointing that the government did not listen to the many MPs who wanted the UK to do more\", while Oxfam accused ministers of \"closing the door on child refugees who have fled terrible violence\". Earlier, Ms Allen, who tabled the amendment, said the UK had done an \"amazing job\" in terms of welcoming 20, 000 refugees directly from Syria and its neighbouring countries and providing more than £2bn in aid to help those displaced by the six-year conflict. But she said helping unaccompanied children already in Europe was a \"final piece in the jigsaw\" where the UK was currently falling short.\"This is a global crisis and we need to play our part,\" she told the BBC.\"The Dubs amendment moved us as a nation. We could not not respond to that terrible image of a little boy washed up on the beach.\"We have decided to end the Dubs scheme neatly at the end of the financial year. Humanitarian crises won\'t end at the end of the financial year nor should our compassion.\"Amir\'s story Seventeen-year-old Amir lived with his family in the Syrian city of Aleppo, for years the scene of some of the country\'s worst fighting. His parents were so frightened that their only son would end up as a fighter, either for government forces or for the Free Syrian army, that they took the decision to get him out of the country. He told the BBC: \"It was like a horror film, bombs every day, everybody scared, the only choice is to wait for death or leave.\"In 2015, his parents paid people smugglers to transport Amir to Turkey. He was 15. He describes how from there he travelled through seven other European countries alone, sometimes negotiating with traffickers. Helped by the charity Safe Passage, he was transferred to the UK from France last autumn. He is one of 200 unaccompanied under 18s who have been re-settled here under the Dubs scheme.\"It\'s so sad the government is closing the scheme. There are lots of children having bad times with no one to care for them. We will be grateful if the British government can help others to survive,\" he said. Ms Allen, the MP for South Cambridgeshire, said she had been assured by bodies representing councils that many still had the scope to accept children and that an annual audit, with a duty on ministers to report back to Parliament, would help them to do so.\"Some councils are absolutely bursting, they cannot take any more. \"They have done an amazing job. But there are those still stepping forward and we have not taken them up on their offers.\"The MP\'s amendment - tabled at Report Stage of the legislation - had won the backing of Labour and the Lib Dems as well as prominent former Conservative ministers including Nicky Morgan, Tim Loughton and Anna Soubry. Faith leaders and prominent actors, including Juliet Stevenson, Rhys Ifans and Toby Jones, led a demonstration outside the Commons during Tuesday\'s debate designed to increase pressure on the government. A government spokesman said: \"We set up the national transfer scheme to ensure that caring responsibilities for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are shared by local authorities across the country in a way that is fair and in the best interest of the children.\"We continue to encourage local authorities to participate in this scheme. \"Each year around 3, 000 children arrive in the UK and claim asylum, which is in addition to children placed in a local authority area through our resettlement schemes from the Middle East and North Africa region. \"Last year, the UK granted protection or another form of leave to more than 8, 000 children.\"',politics
'MWC 2017: Samsung unveils two new tablets but no phone Samsung has, for the first time since 2013, opted not to unveil a flagship Galaxy S smartphone at the Mobile World Congress tech show. Instead, it showed off two new tablet computers and a virtual reality headset that comes with a remote control. However, a new smartphone was briefly teased at the end of the company\'s presentation at the Barcelona event. Samsung said the new device would be unveiled on 29 March in New York.\"Not having [the successor to the S7] there will be a particular boon to Huawei,\" noted tech analyst Tim Coulling at Canalys, referring to Samsung\'s Chinese rival. \"But it\'s known something is coming out, so the Samsung fans will probably be willing to wait.\"The hiatus follows trouble for the South Korean tech giant after its Galaxy Note 7 phone had to recalled twice, the second time permanently. Faulty batteries in the devices led some to catch fire. Greenpeace protest Campaign group Greenpeace made an unexpected appearance at the presentation. A protestor took to the stage with a banner saying \"reduce, reuse, recycle\" - apparently referring to the millions of Note 7 handsets that had to be withdrawn. More protestors rolled out another banner on the side of the building where the press conference was taking place. Of the new tablets, the Galaxy Tab S3 is the smaller of the two and comes with a 9. 7in (24. 6cm) screen. It is targeted at consumers who want to prioritise gaming and video playback. The larger Galaxy Book comes in two sizes: 10. 6in and 12in. Samsung said it was suited to \"on-the-go professionals\". It comes with a snap-on keyboard and S-Pen stylus. The S3 runs Android 7. 0 Nougat while the Book\'s operating system is Windows 10. \"Like most of its competitors, Samsung has seen its tablet sales erode in recent years, as larger smartphones have pushed into tablet territory,\" noted Rhoda Alexander at analysts IHS Technology. But she added that the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and powerful specifications of the new tablets should help differentiate the products from competitors. Virtual gear Samsung also launched a Gear VR headset and remote control. As with previous generations, the headset is a tie-up with Facebook\'s Oculus division. The remote is designed for one-handed control. It features a touchpad that lets users select options within virtual reality apps, and motion sensors to detect hand movements. In the past, owners had to use controls built into the headset or buy a third-party gamepad. That compared unfavourably with Google\'s rival Daydream View headset, which featured a motion-sensing controller of its own. The new Gear VR is compatible with the recent Galaxy S and Note handsets.',tech

'Douglas Carswell quitting UKIP to become independent MP for Clacton UKIP\'s Douglas Carswell is quitting the party to become an independent MP and says he is doing so \"amicably\".

'Can technology solve Chicago\'s gun crime problem? Chicago has one of the highest murder rates in the US, with 51 homicides in January alone. And President Donald Trump has threatened to \"send in the Feds\" if the \"totally out of control\" city cannot halt the \"carnage\". But, now, Chicago has spent $1m (£800, 000) on ShotSpotter, installing hundreds of sensors in high-crime areas across two of its districts. And whenever a gun is fired, police officers are immediately given the exact location via a smartphone app. How ShotSpotter works Nearly 100 US cities are now using ShotSpotter - but, despite its success, some remain unconvinced. Dover, the second largest city in Delaware, for example, has said the $195, 000 annual cost could be better spent elsewhere. Quincy in Washington and Charlotte in North Carolina have also decided the technology is not for them. Serious criminals But ShotSpotter chief executive Ralph Clark said some of the cities that have signed up have seen a 35\% year-on-year drop in gunfire.\"We are seeing thousands of incidents,\" he told the BBC.\"These are not homicides or woundings, but they are still serious crimes.\"These gunshots are not coming from thousands of people messing about, we are finding that it is from a few serious criminals - the authorised shooters in gangs who are using it to intimidate people, protect their turf.\"\"The biggest lever in reducing gun violence is to de-normalise it, and people are now seeing the police respond to these incidents, and they can see that the police are serving and protecting their communities.\" Heat list Three years ago, Chicago made a $2m investment in a predictive policing algorithm, which calculated potential victims of gun crime based on two variables, including how many times they had been arrested with others who later became gun crime victims. Developed by the Illinois Institute of Technology, the system generates a heat list of people most likely to kill or be killed. But according to a recent report from non-profit organisation The Rand Corporation, the investment has had little effect and simply means those on the watch list are more likely to be arrested. The Chicago Police Department countered that the report did not represent the prediction model as it currently worked and denied the system was deficient. Threat level Fresno Police Department, in California, recently tested software known as Beware - which sifts through address-specific public data and individuals\' public postings to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter - to alert first responders on the way to a 911 emergency call. The platform, built by security company Intrado, colour codes people\'s threat level as green, yellow or red. But one member of the city council told the that his threat level was yellow, due to a previous occupant of his address.\"Even though it\'s not me that\'s the yellow guy, your officers are going to treat whoever comes out of that house in his boxer shorts as the yellow guy,\" he said.

'Just google it: The student project that changed the world \"Dad, what happens when you die?\" \"I don\'t know, son. Nobody knows for sure.\" \"Why don\'t you ask Google?\"Of course, Google isn\'t clever enough to tell us whether there is life after death, but the word \"google\" does crop up in conversation more often than either \"clever\" or \"death\", according to researchers at the UK\'s University of Lancaster. It took just two decades for Google to reach this cultural ubiquity, from its humble beginnings as a student project at Stanford University in California. It is hard to remember just how bad search technology was before Google. In 1998, for example, if you typed \"cars\" into Lycos - then a leading search engine - you would get a results page filled with porn websites. Why? Owners of porn websites inserted many mentions of popular search terms such as \"cars\" in tiny text or in white on a white background. The Lycos algorithm saw many mentions of \"cars\", and concluded the page would be interesting to someone searching for \"cars\". In the Google era, this seems almost laughably simplistic. But Google\'s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were not, initially, interested in designing a better way to search. Their Stanford project had a more scholarly motivation. In academia, how often a published paper is cited is a measure of its credibility, and if it is cited by papers that themselves are cited many times, that bestows even more credibility. Mr Page and Mr Brin realised that if they could find a way to analyse all the links on the nascent world wide web, they could rank the credibility of each web page in any given subject. To do this, they first had to download the entire internet. This caused some consternation. It gobbled up nearly half of Stanford\'s bandwidth. Irate webmasters showered the university with complaints that Google\'s crawler was overloading their servers. More from Tim Harford But as Mr Page and Mr Brin refined their algorithm, it became clear they had discovered a vastly better way to search the web. Porn websites with tiny text saying \"cars cars cars\" don\'t get many links from other websites that discuss cars. If you searched Google for \"cars\", its analysis would be likely to yield results about… cars. Mr Page and Mr Brin quickly attracted investors, and Google went from student project to private company. It is now among the world\'s biggest, bringing in profits by the tens of billions. But for the first few years, Mr Page and Mr Brin burned through money without knowing how or if they would make it back. They were not alone. During the dotcom boom, shares in loss-making internet companies traded at absurd prices, in anticipation that they would eventually figure out viable business models. Speed and transparency Google found its model in 2001: pay-per-click advertising. Advertisers pay Google when someone clicks through to their website, having searched for specified terms. Google displays the highest-bidders\' ads alongside its \"organic\" search results. From an advertiser\'s perspective, the appeal is clear: you pay only when you reach people who have demonstrated an interest in your offering. It is much more efficient than paying to advertise in a newspaper. Even if its readership matches your target demographic, inevitably most people who see your newspaper advert won\'t be interested in what you are selling. No wonder has fallen off a cliff. The media\'s scramble for new business models is one obvious economic impact of Google search. But the invention of functional search technology has created value in many ways. A few years ago, . One is timesaving. Studies suggest that googling is about three times as quick as finding information in a library, even discounting the time spent getting there. Likewise, finding a business online is about three times faster than using a printed directory such as the Yellow Pages. McKinsey put the productivity gains of this into the hundreds of billions. Another benefit is price transparency - economist jargon for being able to stand in a shop, take out your phone, google a product you\'re thinking of buying and seeing if it\'s available more cheaply elsewhere, then using that knowledge to haggle - annoying for the shop, helpful for the customer. Then there are \"long tail\" effects. In physical shops, it makes no sense to display aisle after aisle of obscure products that will be bought only rarely - they focus on a limited range of bestsellers instead. Natural monopoly? But a decent search facility makes it easy to find a needle in the product haystack, and that has enabled the rise of online shops offering more variety. Customers with specific desires are more likely to find exactly what they want, rather than settling for the nearest thing available in the local supermarket.

Google dominates the search market, handling close to 90\% of searches worldwide. Many businesses rely on ranking highly in its organic search results. And Google constantly tweaks the algorithm that decides them. Google gives general advice about how to do well, but it is not transparent about how it ranks results - not least because that would give away the information necessary to game the system. We would be back to searching for cars and getting porn. You don\'t have to look far online (thanks, Google) to find business owners and search strategy consultants gnashing their teeth over the company\'s power to make or break them. If Google thinks you are employing tactics it considers unacceptable, it will downgrade you. One blogger complains that Google is \"judge, jury and executioner\". \"You get penalised on suspicion of breaking the rules, [and] you don\'t even know what the rules are,\" they say. Trying to figure out how to please Google\'s algorithm is rather like trying to appease an omnipotent, capricious and ultimately unknowable god. You may say as long as Google\'s top results are useful to searchers, it\'s tough luck on those who rank lower - and if those results stop being useful, then some other pair of students at Stanford will spot the gap in the market and dream up a better way. Right? Maybe - or maybe not. Search was a competitive business in the late 1990s. But now, it may be a natural monopoly - in other words, an industry that is extremely hard for a second entrant to succeed in. The reason? Among the best ways to improve the usefulness of search results is to analyse which links were ultimately clicked by people who previously performed the same search, as well as what the user has searched for before. Google has far more of that data than anyone else. That suggests the company may continue to shape our access to knowledge for generations to come.

'Top Gear: What did the critics think of the new series? The latest series of Top Gear has been praised by critics - but many say there is still room for improvement. This series sees Matt LeBlanc, Rory Reid and Chris Harris take the lead presenting roles after the last year. Writing in , Ed Power described it as a \"roaring return\". But critic Frances Taylor wrote: \"What they haven\'t yet perfected or polished is a slick dynamic between the three of them.\" An average of 2. 8 million viewers tuned in to the first episode on Sunday evening - with a peak of 3. 1 million as the show reached its climax. Last year\'s opening episode was by 4. 4 million people but the viewing figures considerably as the series went on. Ed Power said: \"If a few clunking elements still need tinkering with, the all new Top Gear nonetheless impressed as it left the starting grid.\"Whether it can keep up the momentum across the next two months is harder to predict.\" Digital Spy\'s said the show was \"MUCH more fun than last year\". He wrote: \"The weak link of 2016 has gone in the shape of Chris Evans, and the best three presenters have been elevated to an equal status. And it\'s worked wonders.\"But, he added: \"There are still a few quibbles that need to be ironed out in time. Mainly, the studio segments still feel a little forced.\" Caroline Frost of said: \"From the off, it was immediately clear that the new team of Matt LeBlanc, Chris Harris and Rory Reid, has worked tirelessly to play to its strengths, previously overshadowed by former frontman Chris Evans.\"She added: \"What they do now have is a bit more chemistry between the hosts. The return to three people was a solid decision and while some might not want a name like LeBlanc involved, he\'s good at what he does here and he\'s enjoyable to watch.\"\'s Sam Wollaston compared the new trio\'s chemistry with their predecessors. \"Whatever you think of [Clarkson, Hammond and May\'s] asinine, middle-aged laddishness, it\'s hard to deny that there was something between them, a connection, a chemistry,\" he wrote.\"Here, though, it\'s more like speed-dating: no one really seems to know anyone else. \"It\'s not quite working yet. They are overdoing the bants - laughing too hard at Matt\'s gags, and trying too hard with their own.\" \'s Frances Taylor said: \"What is immediately clear is that Evans\' bulky salary has instead been spent on the show itself, making everything a little bit bigger and dynamic and look so much better.\"What they haven\'t yet perfected or polished is a slick dynamic between the three of them and a natural chemistry doesn\'t shine through. It\'s still not quite there.\" Writing in , Ally Ross said: \"Matt LeBlanc may still come across like Dylan from The Magic Roundabout, but he is now capable of looking all of his co-hosts in the eye for more than 2. 3 seconds.\"This small miracle is possible, of course, because BBC2 has got rid of the shouty ginger tyrant, Chris Evans, and that hideous yellow T-shirt he wore every single episode of his short yet noisy tenure.\" Many of you have been getting in touch with us over email to let us know what you thought of the new series.

'Brexit bill: Parliament clears way for talks with EU Parliament has passed the Brexit bill, paving the way for the government to trigger Article 50 so the UK can leave the European Union. Peers backed down over the issues of EU residency rights and a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal after their objections were overturned by MPs. The bill is expected to receive Royal Assent and become law on Tuesday. This means Theresa May is free to push the button on withdrawal talks - now expected in the last week of March. The result came as Scotland\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that she intended to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence at a time when Brexit negotiations are expected to be reaching a conclusion. Ms Sturgeon said she wanted a vote to be held between autumn 2018 and spring 2019 - but there is speculation that Mrs May will reject the idea of the referendum being held before the Brexit process is completed. That Brexit process is set to take two years from when Mrs May invokes Article 50, which formally gives the EU notice of the UK\'s intention to leave. Brexit Secretary David Davis said. \"We are now on the threshold of the most important negotiation for our country in a generation.\" The was passed unamended late on Monday after peers voted by 274 votes to 118 not to challenge the Commons again over the issue of whether Parliament should have a veto on the terms of exit. The House of Lords also agreed not to reinsert guarantees over the status of EU residents in the UK into the bill, with the government winning the vote by a margin of 274 votes to 135. Later analysis of the division list for the first Lords vote on EU citizens\' rights to remain in the UK showed that 25 Labour peers sided with the Lib Dems, including former cabinet minister Lord Mandelson. Earlier, the government had comfortably won votes on the issues in the Commons, with only a handful of Tory MPs rebelling. Corbyn to \'challenge plans\' The votes came after Brexit minister Lord Bridges of Headley warned that now was not the time to \"return to the fray\" by inserting \"terms and conditions\" in the legislation. Labour\'s spokeswoman Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town attacked the Lib Dems for not being responsible and \"falsely raising\" people\'s hopes on the rights of EU citizens living in the UK. Liberal Democrat Lord Oates said the government had failed to make concessions over the position of EU nationals living in the UK and called on peers to insist on changes. Brexit campaigners welcomed the \"clear mandate\" given to the UK government ahead of the start of official negotiations.\"Now, it\'s time to go into these negotiations with some ambition and support the government, so it can secure the very best deal - one that is good for the whole UK, and good for the EU too,\" said Tory MP and former minister Dominic Raab. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the rejection of the Lords amendments was \"deeply disappointing\" but insisted the opposition would continue to press for the rights of EU nationals to be prioritised and for the maximum parliamentary oversight of the process. He tweeted: \"Labour at every stage will challenge govt plans for a bargain basement Brexit with our alternative that puts jobs &amp; living standards first.\" Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

'US man loses appeal over encrypted drives A US man has lost an appeal over his refusal to decrypt hard drives seized during an investigation regarding child sexual abuse images. The man, who has not been named in court documents, has been held in custody for nearly 18 months. No criminal charges have been filed against him. The man\'s lawyer has argued that his client is protected by the Fifth Amendment, which protects US citizens from incriminating themselves. A police search in 2015 at the suspect\'s home recovered an Apple iPhone 5S, Mac Pro computer and two external hard drives. Authorities allege that they found evidence suggesting that child sexual abuse images had been accessed with the devices after they were able to decrypt the Mac Pro. Prosecutors also say that images of a six-year-old girl that \"focused\" on her genitals were found on his iPhone 6 Plus, which had been seized separately and which the suspect unlocked during a forensic examination. The external hard drives remain inaccessible, however, and the suspect has been held in contempt of court - and remanded in custody - since late 2015. At one hearing, court documents say the suspect claimed he could not remember the password to unlock the drives.\'Disappointed by ruling\' \"The government has provided evidence to show both that files exist on the encrypted portions of the devices and that [the suspect] can access them,\" wrote the circuit judges, rejecting the appeal. They added that they disagreed the Fifth Amendment was grounds for a successful appeal in this instance.\"We are disappointed in the ruling and [are] studying the decision to determine what further review it may be appropriate to seek,\" said Keith Donoghue, a federal defender representing the suspect.\"The fact remains that the government has not brought charges and our client has now been in custody for nearly 18 months based on his assertion of his constitutional right against self-incrimination.\"The US Supreme Court has never ruled on the issue of whether suspects can cite constitutional protection when refusing to unlock a smartphone or decrypt a computer drive.

'Why Apple\'s red iPhones are not \'Red\' in China Apple\'s latest iPhone might be red, but it\'s not Red in China. The special-edition version of the iPhone 7 and 7plus goes on sale in more than 40 countries, but China has done it slightly differently. The BBC explains why. What is Red about? Red is a charity looking to combat Aids and was originally founded by U2 musician Bono and activist Bobby Shriver. It gives the money it raises to the Global Fund for HIV/Aids that doles out grants. This includes providing testing and treatment for patients with the aim of wiping out transmission of HIV. Apple is the world\'s largest corporate donor to the Global Fund. The celebrate Apple\'s long-running partnership with Red and a portion of the sales will go towards its relief operations in Africa. But Apple\'s Chinese-language sites don\'t mention the product or cause. This left some perplexed. Internet users were among the first to spot that there was different branding on Apple\'s landing page depending on the Chinese territory. When translated from Mandarin, Apple\'s China retail website for the Red devices simply read as \"now in red\" while the Taiwanese site used the words \"product\" Red which the US and other countries have as well. Some analysts read this as yet another example of Chinese politics interfering with Western brands looking to do business in the world\'s most populous nation. Apple had no comment on the matter. So why the different name? One possibility is that Apple is looking to navigate sensitivities in a state where messages are controlled: HIV/Aids and homosexuality remain taboo topics in China. The first case of HIV in China was recorded in 1989. By 2000 the disease was found in most of China, and as it continued to spread, the government kept denying the problem. Today discrimination against Aids patients is common. Any other contentious issues? Well there\'s the Dalai Lama. Earlier this year Red\'s Instagram page showed a picture of the Tibetan spiritual leader, whom China considers a dangerous separatist. This has ledHow will Red do in China? Apple has faced numerous challenges in China of late, which may be one of the reasons why it is offering the Red iPhones as a colour option as opposed to a product. Last year Apple\'s online film and book services in China. Apple was also made to from the China App store following a request from the authorities. But the red iPhones are poised to sell well because the colour is considered to be the most auspicious in Chinese culture and it is considered a prestige product there. The tech behemoth is clearly trying to maintain relations with its fastest-growing sales region. Apple chief executive Tim Cook has been making semi-regular trips to China and is opening four research and development centres later this year.',business

'Budget 2017: £2bn for social care and tax rise for self-employed Chancellor Philip Hammond has increased National Insurance bills for self-employed people in his first Budget - leading to accusations he has broken a manifesto pledge not to raise taxes. There was also £2bn for social care services in England, and help for firms hit by business rate rises. On the economy he said growth was expected to be higher - and borrowing lower - than forecast in November. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was \"a Budget of utter complacency\". Mr Hammond said there had been a \"dramatic increase\" in the number of people working as self-employed - and that the reason for doing so should not be \"differences in tax treatment\". The disparity between the rates paid by the self-employed and employees \"undermines the fairness of our tax system\", he said. Class 4 National Insurance contributions will go up to 10\% from 9\% and to 11\% in April 2019, Mr Hammond told MPs. On its own, the change announced in the Budget would affect 2. 5 million people. But a separate category of National Insurance payments, Class 2, are already due to be abolished from 2018, and Mr Hammond said that taken together the two changes meant NI payments for a self-employed person would be on average 60p a week higher. The Treasury later said that 1. 6 million people would, on average, pay £240 more a year and no-one earning less than £16, 250 would be worse off. Mr Hammond said the different National Insurance rates had traditionally reflected a disparity in pension and benefit entitlement between self-employed people and those in employment. But he said these had now been \"very substantially reduced\", and that the government would also consult on addressing disparities in relation to parental benefits. The government immediately faced accusations of breaking a Conservative manifesto pledge not to increase VAT, National Insurance contributions or income tax. Ministers said this promise related to the class of National Insurance paid by employees, not the self-employed. Some Conservative MPs also raised concerns. \"I don\'t think we should be going out of our way to tax work, growth and enterprise and success,\" said former Tory minister John Redwood. Read more - Cash for social care The government has been under pressure to offer more resources for social care budgets, with council leaders warning the entire system stands on the \"brink of collapse\" without an immediate cash injection and a commitment to a long-term solution. Mr Hammond acknowledged the system was under pressure with an ageing population, and said the new £2bn for services in England over the next three years would allow councils to \"act now to commission new care packages\". He also said the government would set out the options for long-term funding of the social care system later in the year - although these would not include a \"death tax\". Read more - Economy \'confounding commentators\' Opening his statement, Mr Hammond said the UK economy \"continued to confound the commentators with robust growth\", and promised his Budget would provide a \"strong and stable platform\" for the Brexit negotiations to come. As predicted, there were improved economic forecasts via the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The OBR has revised up its growth forecast from 1. 4\% to 2\% for 2017, predicting it will slow to 1. 6\% in 2018 before returning to 2\% in 2021. Due to \"a number of one-off factors\", borrowing was predicted to be £16. 8bn lower than previously forecast, the chancellor said. However, as the UK prepares for Brexit, Mr Hammond said there was \"no room for complacency\", and that the UK\'s deficit was still high, and productivity \"stubbornly low\". Read more - Date for balancing the UK\'s books delayed again... According to the , the government \"does not appear to be on track\" to meet one of its key fiscal targets. Mr Hammond told MPs the deficit, the difference between what the government spends and what it receives, was \"down by over two thirds\". In 2010 the Conservatives\' original target was to eliminate the deficit by 2015. That has since slipped year-by-year and in November\'s Autumn Statement Mr Hammond pledged to eliminate it \"as early as possible in the next Parliament\". But the OBR said: \"The deficit falls little in 2020-21 and 2021-22, while the ageing population and cost pressures in health are likely to put upward pressure on the deficit in the next Parliament.\"Tobacco and alcohol changes There were no unexpected rises in the Budget, with the chancellor sticking to the previously pencilled-in rises. So a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 35p more from 18: 00, while it will be 44p more for a 30g pack of hand rolled tobacco. A pint of beer will cost 2p more from Monday, from when duty on a bottle of Whisky will rise 36p, with gin up 34p, cider 1p and a bottle of still wine 10p. Business rates Mr Hammond has been facing a backlash, including from Conservative MPs, over businesses facing rates rises as a result of the revaluation of premises that is about to come into force. The chancellor defended the revaluation, although he said he said it \"undoubtedly raised some hard cases\". He announced a £300m \"discretionary fund\" to be used by councils to help companies that are badly hit, and a £50-per-month cap on increases for firms facing the loss of small business relief. In a further measure, he said 90\% of pubs would be given a £1, 000 business rates discount. Read more - Share dividend tax change - and other announcements The biggest money raising measure was a reduction in the total amount of dividends company directors and shareholders can receive from businesses without having to pay taxes, from £5, 000 to £2, 000. Mr Hammond said the move was meant to \"address the unfairness\" around the dividend tax advantage, which he claimed was \"an extremely generous tax break for investors with substantial share portfolios\". Other measures included: £100m for new triages in English hospitals and an extra £325m for NHS reform programmes to support people returning to work after a career break Transport spending of £90m for the north of England and £23m for the Midlands to address \"pinch points\" on roads £20m to support the campaign against violence against women and girls £270m for maintenance of existing schools Extending free transport to all free school meals pupils who attend selective schools No change to previously-planned upratings of duties on alcohol and tobacco Additional funding of £350m for the Scottish government, £200m for the Welsh government and almost £120m for the Northern Ireland Executive What the other parties said Responding to Mr Hammond, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Budget ignored the \"crisis facing our public services and the reality of daily life for millions of people in this country\". He accused the government of \"cutting services and the living standards of the many, to continue to fund the tax cuts of the few\". He calculated there would be a £70bn tax giveaway for \"those who need it the least\". As an example, he said that instead of using £10m to set up a children\'s funeral fund, the government was cutting support for bereaved families. For the SNP, Stewart Hosie said Brexit had barely been mentioned, despite the \"momentous\" challenge it posed. The Liberal Democrats said the social care announcement \"gives sticking plasters a bad name\".\"It is a woefully inadequate response to the impossible pressure the NHS and care services are under,\" Norman Lamb, the party\'s health spokesman, said. UKIP MP Douglas Carswell criticised what he called an \"attack\" on self-employed people through National Insurance rates, and said the Budget was not \"fundamentally sorting out the biggest problem we face\", the UK\'s debt. BBC editors\' analysis The chancellor repeatedly emphasised that it is a government that says it is preoccupied by \"fairness\" with ministers oft-quoted promise of a \"country that works for everyone\". But does that stack up? The overall picture might be slightly healthier in the government\'s giant balance sheets but it is still extremely challenging - hardly a land of milk and honey. And that slightly cheerier fettle in the forecasts is very different to the public feeling any better off - Uber and Deliveroo - the Treasury is on your case. Philip Hammond regularly cites evidence that the growth of self-employment is undermining the tax base - by between £3. 5bn and £5bn a year by 2020 potentially. Those who are self-employed point out that they are in a much more precarious employment and have often decided to take a risk as entrepreneurs. And they do not receive pension contributions and entitlements such as holiday pay, which are rights for those directly employed by companies - Jokes from \'Spreadsheet Phil\' It wasn\'t all dry economics and tax announcements - the chancellor, billed beforehand as \"Spreadsheet Phil\", also sprinkled some jokes into his 55-minute speech. He played up to his nickname (\"this is the spreadsheet bit, but bear with me because I have a reputation to defend\") but also took aim at Jeremy Corbyn, sitting across the despatch box. The Labour leader, he said, was \"so far down a black hole that even Stephen Hawking has disowned him\", in a reference to the scientist\'s criticism earlier in the week. He didn\'t stop there, quipping later in the speech that \"they don\'t call it the last Labour government for nothing\". He also faced some good-natured heckling from the PM, when he told MPs two of his planned announcements had already been revealed by Theresa May.\"It\'s international women\'s day\", she reminded him. What we already knew Several spending announcements were made ahead of Mr Hammond\'s Commons statement. These included: A £5m fund to mark the centenary of female suffrage next year An extra £500m for in England A one-off £320m for 140 new , which could include grammars Measures to protect people who inadvertently end up after signing up for free trials Plans aimed at helping the North sea industry £500m support for electric vehicles, robotics and artificial intelligence Aside from the Budget, several previously-announced changes come into force in April, including an increase in the personal tax allowance to £11, 500, a new inheritance tax allowance, a rise in the annual ISA limit to £20, 000 and the introduction of a levy to fund apprenticeships. How business reacted The Federation of Small Businesses criticised the changes to National Insurance paid by self-employed people.\"This undermines the government\'s own mission for the UK to be the best place to start and grow a business, and it drives up the cost of doing business,\" said its chairman, Mike Cherry. Mark Littlewood, of the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the chancellor \"defused one bomb\" by providing relief for business rate rises: \"But he has definitely exploded another bomb with this rise in NICs [National Insurance Contributions] for the self-employed.\"For the CBI, the \"limited\" help over business rates \"falls short\". British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall said: \"Businesses had been advised to expect minimal change, rather than a blockbuster Budget, and Philip Hammond did not disappoint.\"',politics
'MWC 2017: DJI drones use plane avoidance tech The world\'s bestselling drone-maker has unveiled models that warn their operators when there is a risk posed by nearby aeroplanes or helicopters. The M200 series use ADS-B (automatic dependent surveillance broadcast) receivers to detect broadcasts from nearby manned flights. The transmissions allow users to see the position, altitude and velocity of surrounding aircraft so they can take evasive action if required. One expert praised the move. \"It\'s an extra safety measure and will help drone operators work in restricted airspace,\" explained Dave Black from the commercial drone services firm Blackwing Aerial. \"The way we tend to do this is to contact air traffic controllers before we fly, tell them where we are flying and then they contact us by phone if there\'s going to be any conflict.\"But in time, the authorities may well also want this kind of feature fitted as standard before they approve operations with larger drones.\" Mr Black added that some enthusiasts had created their own ADS-B kit by connecting a receiver to a Raspberry Pi computer with customised software and then tying this to their drone. But he added that an integrated unit would be appreciated. The announcement was made at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona. False confidence? DJI announced last July that an ADS-B collision avoidance system in conjunction with uAvionix, a specialist in the technology. The M200 series drones, which debut the feature, are designed for industrial applications such as inspecting power lines and mapping construction sites. They have a range of 7km (4. 3 miles) and can stay airborne for up to 38 minutes, but some country\'s regulators currently require them to stay within line-of-sight. The aircraft are bigger and heavier than many consumer drones - they weigh 3. 8kg (8. 4lb) and can carry a further 2kg of equipment - so potentially pose a greater risk if involved in a crash. However, one analyst warned that the new safety system could give drone pilots a false sense of confidence.\"The problem is that ADS-B isn\'t yet required for all aircraft, so even if you had a receiver you\'re not necessarily seeing all the traffic in the area,\" explained Colin Snow, chief executive of the Skylogic Research consultancy. \"Its use is also not required at the low altitudes at which commercial drones tend to fly.\"So, let\'s say you are a farmer in a rural area using a drone. There\'s a danger a crop duster could come into your zone - and they often do not use ADS-B - and catch you unaware.\"The other issue is that you only \'see\' other aircraft when their ADS-B pings are retransmitted from towers on the ground and sometimes that doesn\'t happen.\" ',tech

'UK film industry \'needs government support\' after Brexit The UK movie business must get more support from the government if the sector is to survive after Brexit, a senior figure in the industry has said. Zygi Kamasa, who runs Lionsgate UK, said Britain\'s EU exit could have a \"big impact\" on independent filmmakers. The sector is \"under a lot of pressure\", he told the BBC.\"We have a lot of European co-production money that comes into our movies; we have a lot of movies that are shot across Europe.\"That meant there were a lot of staff moving across Europe and the UK to work on British films. \"There\'s a concern about how that will impact films,\" he said. Changing viewing habits were also hitting production companies, as more on-demand television services show a greater number of films, he said.\"The government, the BFI have to look at ways of keeping that sector alive.\"Public support Lionsgate made the phenomenally successful movie, La La Land. Its UK arm is currently making several films, including a new version of Robin Hood, shot in both the UK and Hungary. The most recent Star Wars film, Rogue One, made by Disney, was shot in the UK. One-quarter of the production costs of UK-made films is essentially borne by taxpayers, as movie production gets a 25\% tax credit. Zygi Kamasa says such public support is vital for smaller, independent producers, but needs reform.\"That\'s applicable to Star Wars that shoots in the UK, and that\'s applicable to low budget movies that shoot in the UK. That\'s a one-size-fits-all tax credit. I\'m not actually sure that\'s the best system.\"\"Culturally, it\'s very important British independent reforms are supported perhaps in a greater way,\" he said.

Andrew Ridgeley on Thursday to criticise the show, titled The Last Days of George Michael. The former Wham! star said the channel had been \"insensitive, contemptuous and reprehensible\" and should have waited until after his friend\'s funeral. But Channel 5 said it was \"a measured account\" of Michael\'s life and death. \"George Michael was a high-profile public figure and there has been legitimate public interest in the circumstances surrounding his death,\" the broadcaster said in a statement. It said the documentary, which aired at 21: 00 GMT on Thursday, had been \"based on contributions from those who knew him and reported on him over many decades\". Ridgeley, who paid to Michael at last month\'s Brit Awards, had called the programme a \"piece of voyeurism\" that should only have been aired \"after a respectful period\". earlier this month that Michael - who was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou - died on Christmas Day as a result of heart and liver disease. Fans of the late singer called Channel 5\'s programme \"\", \"\" and \"\" on Twitter.

'Why has the UK become a nation of political swingers? A few days ago, British politics saw a stunning by-election result in the Cumbrian seat of Copeland. After electing Labour MPs for 80 years, voters changed their minds and elected a Conservative. What makes voters do this, and why is swing voting on the rise? Back in the 1960s, about 13\% of voters would change which party they voted for, says Dr Jonathan Mellon from Nuffield College, Oxford. In 2015, that was closer to 40\%. \"A really large proportion of voters are swingers - and this has been steadily increasing in each subsequent election,\" says Dr Mellon. There have always been some voters who changed their minds. The classic swing voter has no particular allegiance to any one party, and may choose a different party from one election to the next. Their decision can decide the outcome of an election, but this usually happens indirectly. \"Either you\'ll get swings from the major parties to minor parties - such as traditionally the Liberal Democrats but now also UKIP, the Greens, the SNP - or you\'ll see voters swing back to one of the major parties,\" Dr Mellon says. Joe Twyman, head of political and social research at the polling company YouGov, analysed swing voting at the most recent general election. \"One way of shifting that surprised a lot of people was the move from the Liberal Democrats to UKIP, and when people saw the data on that they would say, \'Well hang on, that doesn\'t make any sense, the ideology and the policies of Liberal Democrats are very different from those of UKIP. Why should people do that?\' \"But it\'s about protest.\" In the past few years, all the major parties have provided reasons for voters to turn against them. The Conservatives damaged their reputation with Black Wednesday, a day-long economic crisis in 1992. The Labour Party lost a million votes after the Iraq War, with many loyal members defecting to the Liberal Democrats or the Green Party. Liberal Democrat activist Tom Southern witnessed voters turn against his party, angry with it for joining a Conservative-led coalition government and raising university tuition fees. \"It was clear immediately that around half the support had been wiped out within months if not weeks,\" he says. And yet the coalition government was also beneficial to the smaller parties, including the Liberal Democrats. The public saw that a minor party had teamed up with a major party and was now in government. And this impression was reinforced during the 2015 general election campaign, when the leaders of seven different parties appeared on TV debates. The media proclaimed that any one of the smaller parties might hold the balance of power. This campaign proved to be a catalyst for voters. One in every 12 people in the UK voted for UKIP. One in two people in Scotland voted for the SNP. It is much rarer for voters to switch between Labour and the Conservatives. But the Copeland by-election is a reminder that this does happen. James Tilley, professor of politics at the University of Oxford, has studied one reason why voters might make this move.\"In Britain it is definitely the case that older people are much more likely to vote for the Conservatives than younger people,\" he says. As voters get older, they are about 20\% more likely to vote for the Conservative Party. But the reason for this is hard to identify. \"It could be that people born a long time ago are more likely to vote for the Conservatives,\" says Prof Tilley, \"or it could be that as we get older we become more likely to vote for the Conservatives.\" He leans towards the second explanation.\"People generally become a bit more resistant to change as they get older, and I think also that they tend to become less idealistic,\" says Prof Tilley.\"So if parties on the right represent a platform which is more favourable to the status quo, and more about pragmatism than it is about idealism, that might be more attractive to older people than younger people.\"Swing voting is a nightmare for the parties. In the past, MPs relied on their core vote to back them no matter what. Now, they have to spend far more of their time campaigning to keep their seats and far less time legislating. Politicians argue that democracy is less efficient when voters keep changing their minds. But Rosie Campbell, professor of Politics at Birkbeck, University of London, thinks that politics works best when voters are willing to change their minds. \"In the past, voters stuck with parties that had let them down, or had morphed into something they didn\'t like,\" she says.\"Even if the future is more chaotic, the rise of the swinging mindset might just be the change our political system so desperately needs.\"Analysis: How Voters Decide, presented by Prof Rosie Campbell, is on BBC Radio 4 at 20: 30 on Monday 27 February and .',politics
'Chevrolet to offer unlimited data plan with cars Chevrolet has become the first carmaker to offer an unlimited data plan with its cars. The deal, for a 4G LTE data plan, applies to cars sold in the US from 3 March and will cost $20 (£16) a month. It is being offered with the help of US carrier OnStar and will see vehicles fitted with a wi-fi hotspot that connects to the web via LTE. Chevrolet said it was offering the deal because in-car data use had grown so fast. Figures gathered by Chevrolet suggest the amount of data used via wi-fi in its cars jumped by 200\% last year. In 2016, it said, Chevrolet in-car hotspots had handled about four million gigabytes of data. The LTE-based hotspots are available across the entire range of vehicles made by Chevrolet. The system allows owners to connect up to seven devices at a time. Ford also announced this week that it had signed a deal with Vodafone to put 4G modems in its cars. It has not yet released any information about prices but said the system would be an optional extra available in cars sold across Europe from 2018. In its announcement, Ford said the 4G hotspots would use wi-fi so passengers could connect directly rather than by using Bluetooth. Car owners will be able to use up to 10 devices in a car at any one time.',tech

'Activewear sales in Australia expected to soar Bright tights and Lycra tops are a hallmark of an industry worth $270bn (£220bn) worldwide. And in Australia, the wearing of so-called activewear - whether or not you are doing sport - has become something of a phenomenon. at the use of the clothing for such high-octane activity as drinking coffee or going shopping became a viral online hit in 2015. And now activewear trends are the focus of academic research, which suggests sports brands have been slow to recognise the needs of female customers. A study by Victoria University in Australia says a desire to exercise \"anywhere and anytime\" is driving growth, as more and more women try to fit informal exercise into a busy schedule. According to Prof Clare Hanlon, the industry took a long time to realise it needed to evolve. Now it is successfully cashing in. \"Finally companies are understanding the effects physical activity trends have on their industry and are listening to female customers on what they need,\" she says. That includes rethinking how exercise clothes are sold, and improving things like store changing rooms. Shopping experience \"Companies have realised sport isn\'t just for guys,\" says Shannon Walker from the Australian Sporting Goods Association (ASGA), which commissioned the research. He says brands have had to offer a better shopping experience to women.\"They don\'t want to go to the old-fashioned sports store set up to cater for men. They want a retail experience set up for their needs.\"In Australia, activewear sales are expected to grow by more than 20\% between 2015-20, with a large proportion of goods sold online. Julie Stevanja started internet retailer Stylerunner in 2012, after becoming frustrated at the lack of choice available in the shops. It soon became one of the fastest growing companies in Australia, and her sights are now set on expanding the business in Asia.\'Everyone wants to be healthier\' \"There\'s been a huge shift to wellness,\" Ms Stevanja said during a visit to her Sydney warehouse. \"Everyone wants to be healthier and look better. They go hand in hand.\"She also believes \"enclothed cognition\" - the idea that clothes help determine a person\'s behaviour - may have had a role in the popularity of activewear.\"I think if you are in your activewear at the weekend, you\'re probably more likely to buy a green juice or a smoothie than you are to have a milkshake,\" she says. \"People want to make healthier lifestyle choices. Sometimes the first step is actually associating with it, wearing something that makes you feel healthier.\"Prof Hanlon from Victoria University agrees that the simple act of wearing activewear may help people feel they can become healthier. \"The research we\'ve conducted... shows females believe activewear facilitates physical activity and good health,\" she says. The next step for the research team will be a national survey to understand what determines how customers choose their garments, and what language brands can use to entice them. ',business

'Council elections attracted most voter fraud reports English council elections attracted the most electoral fraud reports last year, nearly twice as many as the EU referendum, UK police data shows. Of the 260 complaints made to police in 2016, 121 were about local government elections and 66 about the referendum. The number of voter fraud reports rose - particularly allegations of people voting under someone else\'s name. West Yorkshire Police received the most electoral fraud reports - 49 - while the Metropolitan Police received 30. The Electoral Commission report identified only two local authority areas with more than seven allegations of fraud - Bradford and Kirklees, both in West Yorkshire. The report noted that both areas had increased measures in place to tackle fraud. While 5. 3 million votes were cast in last year\'s local elections, 33. 6 million were cast in the EU referendum. The Electoral Commission said evidence suggested most alleged electoral fraud cases related to local government elections rather than elections to the UK Parliament or other legislative bodies. Ward elections One of the reasons for this was that \"the margin of victory for ward elections is often relatively small\" so it was easier to influence the outcome, it said. Reports of \"personation\" in polling stations - votes cast in someone else\'s name - increased from 21 in 2014 to 44 in 2016. Examples included a man in East Ayrshire who, during the EU referendum, turned up at a polling station and voted under his friend\'s name before returning later in the day to vote again as himself. He raised suspicions, the report says, as \"he was very tall and wore distinctive clothing\" and was challenged. He was able to prove his identity, but the case was referred to the police and he later pleaded guilty in court and was given a \"community payback order\" of 300 hours. Another EU referendum voter, in Cheshire West and Chester, voted twice - once using his mother\'s polling card - but was given only a police caution as he did not realise it was a crime. And another, in Oxford, voted under the name of the person registered to do so at his old address. He was also given a caution. In a separate case, an election agent for the Conservatives was cautioned for forging signatures on eight candidate nomination forms in the Preston City Council area. And, in Derbyshire, - having provided a false address to stand as a councillor on Derby City Council. No evidence The Electoral Commission compiled its report based on figures supplied by police forces across the UK. Most of the complaints resulted in no action by police - some because they turned out not to have been an offence or there was not enough evidence to identify an offender. Many cases were resolved locally with informal advice. Two cases were successfully prosecuted, while in six others police cautions were accepted. The commission said there was \"currently no evidence of any large-scale cases of proven electoral fraud relating to the polls held during 2016\" but the data alone did not accurately reflect the problem because many cases would go unreported. But it noted that reports of electoral registration offences had reduced since 2010, when they had accounted for 28\% of electoral fraud cases. Electoral Commission director of electoral administration Ailsa Irvine said: \"The findings from our report show that significant sentences will be imposed when electoral law is broken, and that those responsible for electoral fraud can face jail.\"',politics

'Women In Sport: Number of women in top jobs at UK sporting bodies declining, says study The number of women getting top jobs at UK sporting bodies is down by 6\% since 2014, says a new study which calls the findings \"extremely concerning\". The Women in Sport survey found around half of the 68 Sport England and UK Sport-funded national governing bodies have fewer than 30\% of non-executive director roles filled by women. Under government guidelines coming into effect on 1 April, those organisations must have women on their board, or risk losing funding. Nine of the 68 organisations have no women in senior leadership roles below chief executive level. The British Taekwondo Council, the sport\'s national governing body, has no woman in any leadership or board positions. Overall the number of women on the boards of governing bodies is 30\% on average. Key findings Of the 68 governing bodies, just under half (33) have less than 30\% female non-executive directors For 2016 these included British Cycling, Rugby Football League, England and Wales Cricket Board, Rugby Football Union and the Football Association There has been a decrease in the number of women in senior leadership roles - the most senior paid roles, excluding the chief executive officer Nine of the 68 organisations had no female senior leaders below chief executive level 18\% of chairs are female and 23\% of chief executive officers are women At England Netball, 80\% of senior leaders are female The report concluded: \"Women in Sport is also extremely concerned by the decrease in the number of women in senior leadership roles. While organisations should continue to tackle the diversity of their boards, they also need to broaden their focus, addressing diversity within their organisations more generally.\"Speaking to BBC Sport, Ruth Holdaway, Women in Sport chief executive said: \"There is positivity in the fact that in the seven years we have been doing this audit, we have seen an increase in the number of women at every level of leadership in sport.\"But now we are seeing the figures plateau and for non-executive directors on boards, the figure has sat at around 30\% for the last couple of years. \"That is an average across all of the governing bodies, that masks a disparity, some do better than that and some do worse than that. Half of the national bodies are hitting the 30\% target, the other half have work to do.\"The figures in the study are for 2016 and just 7\% of the Football Association\'s non-executive directors are women - the third lowest in the study. However, the FA has since proposed reforms to appoint more women to its board. British Cycling, which in the study has 17\% of females as non-executive directors, appointed Julie Harrington as its new chief executive on Monday. Holdaway said gender diversity is being held back by life president and honorary roles for men.\"The time is coming for those who are blocking progress to move, \" she said. Director of sport at funding body Sport England, Phil Smith, said organisations have to draw up an action plan of how they will reach the 30\% target by 1 April, or face losing their funding.\"They have enough time to write an action plan, \" Smith told the BBC. \"Public investment in any sports organisations is dependent on organisations reach the standards of the code, anyone who is not able to reach them or have adequate plans to do so, won\'t be able to attract public investment.\"England Hockey currently fail to meet the target, as three of their 12 members (25\%) are women. But chief executive Sally Munday said she was confident they would be able to eventually meet the guidelines.\"We will look at how we can evolve to meet the guidelines,\" Munday told BBC Sport.\"We will not get to 1 April and ask a board member to leave. We have an outstanding board, it just so happens than more are men than women. Over time, as board members leave, we will look at recruiting people who still meet the skill set, but will enable us to meet the recommendations in the guidelines.\"Analysis The new code of governance will come into effect on 1 April and then each sport will be given their own individual deadline to meet the requirements. Some governing bodies will find it easier to diversify than others. The FA\'s recent proposal to reserve three places for women on its board from 2018 still has to be approved by its 122 person council - an overwhelming male body historically resistant to reform. Those that don\'t meet the criteria risk losing millions of pounds of public investment. The Government is also prepared to withdraw essential support for bids to host major events. The consequences for failing to modernise are now more serious than ever.',sport

Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street\'s so-called \"fear gauge\", jumped 10\%. Analysts attributed the share selling to reduced confidence that Mr Trump\'s pro-growth policies, including financial deregulation and tax cuts, would occur any time soon.

'School staff member told \'watch Big Bang Theory\' as Asperger\'s training A member of staff at a Scottish school was told to \"watch The Big Bang Theory\" as training to deal with a pupil with Asperger syndrome, MSPs have been told. Holyrood\'s education committee took evidence on support for pupils with additional needs. Sylvia Haughney, a support for learning instructor, said there was not enough teacher training. She said a support worker had been advised to watch American sitcom The Big Bang Theory as a form of training. Colin Crawford, head of inclusion in the council\'s education services department, accepted there may need to be a review of what training teachers need, but said this should apply when they are at college as much as when working in schools. The Big Bang Theory is a popular American sitcom focusing on a group of highly intelligent but socially inept \"nerds\". One character in particular, Sheldon Cooper, is often singled out by viewers as behaving in a manner consistent with Asperger syndrome, a developmental disorder on the autism spectrum. However, the programme\'s creators have stated that they did not use the syndrome as a basis while creating the character, having said they are \"uncomfortable labelling\" him as having Asperger\'s. Ms Haughney, who has been a support for learning instructor in Glasgow for over 34 years and represents the union Unison, said there had been much better training for dealing with pupils with additional needs when she was going into the profession. She said: \"We were given the training, so we had an understanding. It was direct training, from a psychologist, from a speech language therapist, to give us an understanding and a knowledge of what we were looking for, who we were dealing with and how to go to the next step with that pupil.\"That is just gone. We have this \'cascading\' training, from someone coming and saying \'oh I went on a course, and this is what we do\'.\"Recently I was in a school and I asked a member of staff who was working specifically with a child with Asperger\'s, what training have you had in Asperger\'s? \'I was told to watch The Big Bang Theory\'.\"That\'s the level of training that we\'ve got now in schools.\"\'Huge challenges\' Ms Haughney later said the issue of using cascading in lieu of direct training was \"really serious\", adding that \"if someone has bad practice, they are passing on bad practice\". Prof Sheila Riddell from the University of Edinburgh added that the training for children with additional support needs is \"very, very patchy in Scotland\". Mr Crawford said there needed to be \"creative thinking\" about training, amid \"huge challenges\" of upskilling a large workforce. He said the council worked with other organisations to deliver training, with online courses available too. He said: \"There are a range of developmental checklists, some of which are extremely useful in terms of child development.\"But what I wanted to say is I think there are also issues here in terms of initial teacher training, and the training that\'s offered at colleges to support staff, in terms of upskilling them before they go into the profession. It\'s not necessarily always down to local authority training once staff are in place.\"There\'s a stage before that which needs to be addressed as well in the preparation for going in to working with children and young people.\"Later in the session he added: \"We\'ve focused a lot on training this morning, but what training? Maybe it\'s about, are we needing to think about a training needs analysis of all staff that would give us that baseline of exactly what training staff need to make them feel more confident in the day to day job that they\'re doing.\"',politics
'Facebook artificial intelligence spots suicidal users Facebook has begun using artificial intelligence to identify members that may be at risk of killing themselves. The social network has developed algorithms that spot warning signs in users\' posts and the comments their friends leave in response. After confirmation by Facebook\'s human review team, the company contacts those thought to be at risk of self-harm to suggest ways they can seek help. A suicide helpline chief said the move was \"not just helpful but critical\". The tool is being tested only in the US at present. It marks the first use of AI technology to review messages on the network since founder Mark Zuckerberg that he also hoped to use algorithms to identify posts by terrorists, among other concerning content. Facebook also announced new ways to tackle suicidal behaviour on its Facebook Live broadcast tool and has partnered with several US mental health organisations to let vulnerable users contact them via its Messenger platform. Pattern recognition Facebook has offered advice to users thought to be at risk of suicide for years, but until now it had relied on other users to bring the matter to its attention by clicking on a post\'s report button. It has now developed pattern-recognition algorithms to recognise if someone is struggling, by training them with examples of the posts that have previously been flagged. Talk of sadness and pain, for example, would be one signal. Responses from friends with phrases such as \"Are you OK?\" or \"I\'m worried about you,\" would be another. Once a post has been identified, it is sent for rapid review to the network\'s community operations team.\"We know that speed is critical when things are urgent,\" Facebook product manager Vanessa Callison-Burch told the BBC. The director of the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline praised the effort, but said he hoped Facebook would eventually do more than give advice, by also contacting those that could help. \"It\'s something that we have been discussing with Facebook,\" said Dr John Draper.\"The more we can mobilise the support network of an individual in distress to help them, the more likely they are to get help. \"The question is how we can do that in a way that doesn\'t feel invasive.\"I would say though that what they are now offering is a huge step forward.\"Ms Callison-Burch acknowledged that contact from friends or family was typically more effective than a message from Facebook, but added that it would not always be appropriate for it to inform them.\"We\'re sensitive to privacy and I think we don\'t always know the personal dynamics between people and their friends in that way, so we\'re trying to do something that offers support and options,\" she said. The latest effort to help Facebook Live users follows the death of a 14-year-old-girl in Miami, who livestreamed her suicide on the platform in January. However, the company said it had already begun work on its new tools before the tragedy. The goal is to help at-risk users while they are broadcasting, rather than wait until their completed video has been reviewed some time later. Now, when someone watching the stream clicks a menu option to declare they are concerned, Facebook displays advice to the viewer about ways they can support the broadcaster. The stream is also flagged for immediate review by Facebook\'s own team, who then overlay a message with their own suggestions if appropriate. \"Some might say we should cut off the stream of the video the moment there is a hint of somebody talking about suicide,\" said Jennifer Guadagno, Facebook\'s lead researcher on the project.\"But what the experts emphasised was that cutting off the stream too early would remove the opportunity for people to reach out and offer support.\"So, this opens up the ability for friends and family to reach out to a person in distress at the time they may really need it the most.\"The new system is being rolled out worldwide. A new option to contact a choice of crisis counsellor helplines via Facebook\'s Messenger tool, however, is limited to the US for now.

'Can long-haul air travel also be low cost? Budget airlines have transformed air travel over the past two decades, making a flight almost as cheap as a coach journey for hundreds of millions of travellers. But can the same ever be true for longer journeys as well? Our love affair with budget airlines continues unabated. Ryanair, the Irish carrier that passengers have long loved to hate, last year overtook Lufthansa to become Europe\'s biggest airline by passenger numbers. Norwegian carried about a quarter of Ryanair\'s 117 million passengers in the same period. But unlike its competitors, the Oslo-based airline has found considerable success by flying across the Atlantic from cities including London and Paris for the past four years - and appears to have the likes of IAG worried. The decision by IAG, which owns British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, to is regarded as a direct response to the threat posed by Norwegian. A \"reactionary tit-for-tat move\" is how one analyst describes the move. The Barcelona-based carrier will initially offer flights to four destinations including Los Angeles and Buenos Aires at \"even more affordable\" prices from June. IAG says it sold 52, 000 tickets in the 24 hours after Level\'s website went live last week. The arrival of budget operators on long-haul routes is good news for consumers as they are proving \"very stiff competition for traditional airlines\", says a spokesperson for Abta. But the travel agents\' body points out that passengers may be less willing to put up with a cramped cabin for flights that take many hours - as well as paying extra for food and checked baggage. All airlines must impose air passenger duty of £75 each way, which Abta says is one reason the arrival of Level will not trigger a price war. In addition, it will start with just two planes, but as Gerald Khoo, an airlines analyst at Liberum, notes: \"Two aircraft will not be the sum total of IAG\'s ambitions.\"\'Asleep at the wheel\' Level plans to add more routes with more planes from summer 2018 and is \"talking to other potential European airports where Level may operate\". Khoo expects the UK to be on its wish list, with Manchester a possible first port of call. The advantage of using a new brand such as Level not only allows IAG to keep costs as low as possible, but also means a break with the past. Khoo argues that BA passengers have certain expectations of what the service levels should be, which may no longer be realistic. Norwegian does not suffer from the same problem and seems to be exceeding expectations given its customer satisfaction ratings, he adds. But another analyst who covers IAG says the company \"may have left its run too late - it\'s been asleep at the wheel for too long\". Norwegian started offering the UK\'s first low-cost long-haul flights to the US from Gatwick in July 2014 and has become the third biggest airline at the Sussex airport. It now flies to seven US destinations from Gatwick, with twice-daily departures to New York and a daily flight to Los Angeles. Stuart Buss, a spokesperson for Norwegian, says it had long wanted to fly across the Atlantic but could not make the numbers add up until the arrival of Boeing\'s 787 Dreamliner in late 2011. The plane is largely made of composite materials, making it far lighter and thus much more fuel efficient. Norwegian was one of the first to order the plane and among the first airlines to start flying it. The company has 13 Dreamliners in service, with another 30 on order. \"It\'s been the backbone of our long-haul growth,\" Buss says. The airline will also start flying from Barcelona to the US in June, around the same time that it begins services from Edinburgh, Belfast, Cork, Shannon and Dublin using Boeing single-aisle 737 aircraft. This year Norwegian starts taking delivery of the 737 Max, the latest version of the plane. Buss says its improved fuel efficiency will make it \"another gamechanger\". The airline has 100 of the planes on order, underlining the scale of its ambition. Seasonal swings While putting bums on seats to the US in the summer months at prices as low as £135 each way should not be too difficult, Norwegian may find it more challenging to fill planes from regional cities in the autumn or winter, says one airlines analyst. And despite Michael O\'Leary\'s oft-repeated claims, the analyst doubts Ryanair will ever launch trans-Atlantic services. \"It\'s just not economic - Ryanair could fly from Shannon to Boston now using 737-800 planes, but they can only do one return journey a day, compared with four or five turns on European routes.\" That obstacle does not appear to be deterring other airlines from echoing IAG\'s plans. Lufthansa\'s budget offshoot, Eurowings, flies to countries such as Cuba and Thailand from Germany. Meanwhile, Air France will start long-haul services on its Boost subsidiary next year with the aim of \"opening new routes, re-opening routes closed due to their lack of profitability and maintaining routes under threat\". Next year BA plans to squeeze another 36 economy seats into its Boeing 777 planes that fly from Gatwick to holiday destinations in Florida and the Caribbean, bringing the total to 252. It has also started to charge for food on short-haul flights, further blurring the lines between traditional and budget airlines. When it comes to flying, it seems we very much get what we pay for.',business
'Jimmy Carr: Tax row could have ended my career Jimmy Carr has said the furore over his tax affairs in 2012 could have ended his career. The comedian hit headlines over his involvement in a tax avoidance scheme which the former prime minister, David Cameron, .\"When you\'re in the middle of that [it\'s] like, \'could this be a career-ender?\'\" he told .\"I guess with something like that, that\'s the worst case scenario.\"He added: \"Even worst case scenario, I\'ve had a pretty good run in showbiz terms. I\'ve been at the same level for probably 12 years now - that\'s very lucky to have a long, sustained career in showbiz. \"So it\'s going to disappear at some point.\" The star was widely condemned for taking part in the K2 tax avoidance scheme - something he said was \"a terrible error of judgement\". At the time, Mr Cameron was attending the G20 summit when he broke off from discussions to comment on the affair.\"If the prime minister breaks off from the G20 summit in Mexico - in a meeting with the 19 most important people in the world - and he comes out and makes a press statement about your tax affairs, that is going to need dealing with,\" Carr said.\"You\'ve got to get out in front of it, and also you need to own it. \"Sometimes when footballers are involved in these things, people go: \'Well he probably didn\'t know what was going on and he got advice\'. \"I don\'t think anybody was buying that line with me, I think people thought: \'He probably knew what he was doing\'.\" Carr said a financial adviser had told him of the scheme: \"If someone comes to you and says, \'Do you want to pay less tax? It\'s totally legal, you can do this thing, and if it ever comes up you just have to pay them\' - you go, \'yeah, fine, great\'. \"In the end you make good and say: \'Right I\'ll pay every penny of tax I ever owed.\'\"The comedian said the whole incident taught him that \"when you have a friend in trouble, call\".\"That was the big lesson. \"If you have a friend and they\'re in the paper or they\'re having a problem with something and you don\'t know what to say, or someone\'s just died or someone\'s been diagnosed with something, call them.\"Carr was thought to be one of more than 1, 000 beneficiaries who sheltered some £168m from the taxman each year through the K2 scheme.

'PMQs: May gets personal with Corbyn over grammar schools Theresa May has launched an attack on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for sending his son to a grammar school. At Prime Minister\'s Questions she said: \"Typical Labour, take the advantage and pull up the ladder behind you.\"Mr Corbyn had accused the government of finding money for Mrs May\'s grammar school \"vanity project\" while cutting funding for other schools. The Labour leader\'s son Ben went to a North London grammar school although Mr Corbyn was reported to be against it. The issue is said to have led to the break-up of Mr Corbyn\'s second marriage in the late 1990s, with his then wife Claudia insisting that the child should not attend a local Islington comprehensive school. During Wednesday\'s clashes in the Commons Mr Corbyn accused Mrs May of \"betraying a generation of young people by cutting the funding for every child\" with a new funding formula for schools in England.\"Children will have fewer teachers, larger classes, fewer subjects to choose from and all the Prime Minister can do is focus on her grammar school vanity project that can only ever benefit a few children.\" He said the government found no extra money in the Budget for schools but offered £320m for Mrs May\'s grammar school project. The prime minister said the funding formula would be fair to all but stressed that it was still at the consultation stage and had not been finalised. She then rounded on Mr Corbyn and his front bench team, listing those who attended a private school or a grammar school.\"He sent his own child to a grammar school, he himself went to a grammar school,\" she added, pointing at Mr Corbyn and accusing him of hypocrisy. Analysis by BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg Theresa May\'s government has form on changing its mind when it\'s clear a policy is heading into a political quagmire. After all, it was only seven days ago the chancellor junked the planned tax rises for two million or so self-employed people. Is there another U-turn in the offing? Parents and schools in different parts of the country are cross. Labour, some Tory backbenchers and local councillors around England are riled. And accusations are building again that the Tories would be breaking another manifesto commitment - their 2015 promise to protect the amount of cash that is spent on each pupil at school. There is no question that school budgets are already under a lot of pressure, with many schools having to cut back because money is already short. One of the tough things for the government is that they are hoping to push through a reform where there will be plenty of financial losers at a time when cash is already short, and falling in real terms. But are ministers ready to give up this time? No, or perhaps, not yetMr Corbyn insisted he wanted a \"decent, fair opportunity\" for every child in every school. Mrs May told him: \"He says he wants opportunities for all children, he says he wants good school places for all children - then he should jolly well support the policies we\'re putting forward.\"The prime minister went to a grammar school in Oxford, Wheatley Park, which became a comprehensive while she was there. The government is planning to overturn a long-running ban on opening new grammar schools, which select pupils by ability, but says it has no plans to bring back the 11-plus exam. Education Secretary Justine Greening is consulting on a new formula for schools in England, to address what it calls the \"unfair, opaque and outdated\" distribution of money. It says more than half of schools will receive a cash boost and protections will be put in place to ensure no school loses more than 6\% of their budget in real terms. But it has sparked criticism from head teachers and governors, who have said it does not take account of rising costs and will leave some schools desperately short of cash.',politics
'Facebook failed to remove sexualised images of children Facebook has been criticised for its handling of reports about sexualised images of children on its platform. The chairman of the Commons media committee, Damian Collins, said he had \"grave doubts\" about the effectiveness of its content moderation systems. Mr Collins\' comments come after the BBC reported dozens of photos to Facebook, but more than 80\% were not removed. They included images from groups where users were discussing swapping what appeared to be child abuse material. When provided with examples of the images, Facebook reported the BBC journalists involved to the police and cancelled plans for an interview. It subsequently issued a statement: \"It is against the law for anyone to distribute images of child exploitation.\"Mr Collins said it was extraordinary that the BBC had been reported to the authorities when it was trying to \"help clean up the network\". On its welcome page, Facebook says it does remove obscene material.\"Nudity or other sexually suggestive content\" it states are not allowed on the platform. It encourages users to report inappropriate content via its \"report button\". The US firm says it has improved this system since an . That found \"secret\" groups were being used by paedophiles to meet and swap images. Information the BBC provided to the police led to one man being sent to prison for four years. To test Facebook\'s claim, the BBC used the report button to alert the company to 100 images which appeared to break its guidelines. They included: pages explicitly for men with a sexual interest in children images of under-16s in highly sexualised poses, with obscene comments posted beside them groups with names such as \"hot xxxx schoolgirls\" containing stolen images of real children an image that appeared to be a still from a video of child abuse, with a request below it to share \"child pornography\" Of the 100 images only 18 were removed. According to Facebook\'s automated replies, the other 82 did not breach \"community standards\". They included the apparent freeze frame. Facebook\'s rules forbid convicted sex offenders from having accounts. But the BBC found five convicted paedophiles with profiles, and reported them to Facebook via its own system. None of them were taken down.\"I find it very disturbing, I find that content unacceptable,\" said Mr Collins in response.\"I think it raises the question of how can users make effective complaints to Facebook about content that is disturbing, shouldn\'t be on the site, and have confidence that that will be acted upon.\"The BBC also showed what it had found to Anne Longfield, the Children\'s Commissioner for England. \"I have been very disturbed by what I have seen, very disappointed that one year on we are still seeing images that are very sexualised, totally in my view unacceptable,\" she said.\"The moderation clearly isn\'t being effective, I would question whether humans are moderating this, are looking at this, and also I think it is failing to take account of the context of these images.\" The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) also voiced concern.\"Facebook\'s failure to remove illegal content from its website is appalling and violates the agreements they have in place to protect children,\" said a spokeswoman.\"It also raises the question of what content they consider to be inappropriate and dangerous to children.\"The BBC first asked Facebook for an interview about its moderation system in late-2015, and repeated the request following this follow-up investigation. The social network\'s director of policy Simon Milner agreed to be interviewed last week, on condition the BBC provided examples of the material that it had reported, but had not been removed by moderators. The BBC did so, but was reported to the UK\'s National Crime Agency as a consequence. Mr Collins said this was \"extraordinary - because you\'re trying to help them clean up their network, from material that shouldn\'t be there\". Facebook later provided a statement.\"We have carefully reviewed the content referred to us and have now removed all items that were illegal or against our standards,\" it said.\"This content is no longer on our platform. We take this matter extremely seriously and we continue to improve our reporting and take-down measures.\"It is against the law for anyone to distribute images of child exploitation. \"When the BBC sent us such images we followed our industry\'s standard practice and reported them to Ceop [Child Exploitation &amp; Online Protection Centre]. \"We also reported the child exploitation images that had been shared on our own platform. This matter is now in the hands of the authorities.\"But the BBC\'s director of editorial policy, David Jordan, said the move was surprising.\"The fact that Facebook sent images that had been sent to them, that appear on their site, for their response about how Facebook deals with inappropriate images…the fact that they sent those on to the police seemed to me to be extraordinary,\" he said.\"One can only assume that the Facebook executives were unwilling or certainly reluctant to engage in an interview or a debate about why these images are available on the Facebook site.\"A spokesman for the National Crime Agency said he could not confirm or deny an investigation was underway.',tech
'Zlatan Ibrahimovic: Man Utd striker banned for three games for violent conduct Zlatan Ibrahimovic has accepted a three-match ban for violent conduct for elbowing Bournemouth\'s Tyrone Mings during Saturday\'s The Manchester United striker will miss Monday\'s FA Cup quarter-final at Chelsea and Premier League games against Middlesbrough and West Brom. Mings was also charged with violent conduct by the Football Association. But Bournemouth have said they will appeal against the defender\'s charge. Ibrahimovic, who is United\'s leading scorer this season with 26 goals, is eligible to play in the Europa League tie against Rostov in Russia on Thursday. He is due to return in the Premier League against Everton on 4 April. Mings, 23, landed on the United forward\'s head with his studs before Ibrahimovic, 35, caught his rival in the face with his elbow at a corner. The players were given until 18: 00 GMT on Tuesday to respond to the charge. Deliberate elbowing and stamping are both red card offences. However, the FA suggested Mings could face an increased ban for his offence. An FA statement said: \"The FA has submitted a claim that the standard punishment that would otherwise apply for the misconduct committed by the Bournemouth defender is \'clearly insufficient\'.\"\"Off-the-ball incidents which are not seen at the time by the match officials are referred to a panel of three former elite referees.\"Each referee panel member will review the video footage independently of one another to determine whether they consider it a sending-off offence. For retrospective action to be taken, and an FA charge to follow, the decision of the panel must be unanimous.\"What they said Speaking to the BBC after the match, both Mings and Ibrahimovic denied any intent in their actions. Mings said: \"It was a good battle, you know exactly what you are going to get playing against him. There will be things highlighted more than others, but I enjoyed it.\"Ibrahimovic said Mings had \"jumped into\" his elbow.\"In my situation, I jump up, I jump high,\" the Swede said. \"At the same time I protect myself and unlucky he jumps into me. Many times this occasion happens.\"How the clash unfolded Mings slides into a tackle on Wayne Rooney, also taking out Ibrahimovic. The Bournemouth defender gets to his feet and then hurdles Ibrahimovic, landing on the Swede\'s head with his right boot. United win a corner which is swung in to the far post where Ibrahimovic and Mings challenge for the high ball. Ibrahimovic catches Mings with his right elbow after winning the header, the Bournemouth defender going down to the ground clutching his head. Referee Kevin Friend points for a Bournemouth goal-kick. Bournemouth skipper Andrew Surman pushes Ibrahimovic in the chest, earning a second yellow card from Friend.

'The star fund managers who have doubled savers’ money If you had put £10, 000 into a good savings account 10 years ago, you would now have £11, 361. After inflation, that means a loss in real terms. Frankly, you would have got better value by blowing it on a holiday. But had you invested that cash in any one of half a dozen different equity income funds, you could have doubled your money. In fact, if you had chosen well you could now have over £22, 000. The figures come from a study by Hargreaves Lansdown, which tracked the performance of 30 equity income fund managers over the 10-year period from December 2006 to December 2016. Given that the period included the financial crisis, when stock markets crashed, it is quite an achievement. But Britain\'s best-known fund manager - to those familiar with the industry - is not top of the table. Neil Woodford, who is getting ready to launch his newest fund, comes in at number six. What is an equity income fund? Equity income funds invest in shares, with the idea of producing an annual income for the investor, paid out of the underlying dividends Funds typically require a minimum investment of £100 They are distinct from funds that purely aim to increase the capital value of the investment, known as growth funds However, some of the most successful equity income funds have succeeded in increasing the capital, as well as producing an income or yield Top performers To make it into the study, managers had to have been in the business for at least 10 years. Top performer was Francis Brooke, pictured above, who runs the Trojan Income Fund. Investing with him would have turned £10, 000 into £22, 697 over the 10 years. That sum includes £8, 000 in capital gains, and £4, 000 in income. His fund is one of the least volatile, and is the only one in the sector not to have cut its dividend in the last decade. He puts his success down to a rigorous focus on quality, ignoring \"market noise\" and not chasing returns.\"Our aim is to protect investors\' capital, and to increase its value year-on-year. Our approach is conservative, with attention always paid to the downside risk of any investment,\" he told the BBC. The funds: Francis Brooke: Trojan Income Thomas Moore: SLI UK Equity Income Unconstrained Mark Barnett: Invesco Perpetual High Income Richard Colwell: Threadneedle UK Equity Alpha Income Martin Cholwill: Royal London UK Equity Income Neil Woodford: CF Woodford Equity Income \'Good custodians\' The study also shows that the country\'s best-known fund manager, Neil Woodford, has not performed quite as well over the last 10 years as his former colleague Mark Barnett. The two men previously worked together at Invesco Perpetual in Henley-on-Thames, and ever since their relative performances have been closely scrutinised. But while there may be some quiet satisfaction this weekend in the Barnett camp, some experts still favour Woodford.\"Both have been successful. One has simply been successful over a longer time period,\" says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\"For us that probably means that Woodford edges it over Barnett, but actually they\'re both very good managers. They\'re both very good custodians of your money.\" In just over two weeks\' time, Woodford, pictured above, will launch his newest fund, the Income Focus Fund. But unlike his existing Equity Income Fund, which pays investors around 3. 6\%, this one will aim to pay 5p in the pound during the 2018 calendar year. However, he points out that the combined returns from the Equity Income Fund - taking both capital gain and income into account - are likely to be bigger than from the Income Focus Fund. Last week he told journalists that 2016 had been a poor year for him, but he was optimistic about the prospects for the new fund.\"My view is there\'s more opportunity in the market than I\'ve seen for a long time, and I see a lot of undervalued stocks.\"As one who has pro-Brexit instincts, he also believes that the current economic forecasts are too pessimistic.\"I think the economy will continue to perform better than people think.\"Relative returns If you do want to invest in an equity income fund, the Hargreaves Lansdown research shows you have to choose carefully. As the chart above indicates, good and even average managers have outperformed the wider market. The average manager has turned £10, 000 into £17, 796. However, a poorly performing equity income fund would have returned you only £11, 849, scarcely better than putting your cash in the bank. A high interest savings account would have given you just £11, 361. In both cases you would have been much better off buying a simple tracker fund. A FTSE All-Share tracker would have grown your money to £16, 367. \"You don\'t want to be invested in an average fund; you want to be invested in a good fund,\" says Laith Khalaf. Rather than take the risk of putting your money with a poor fund manager, he says, a FTSE All-Share tracker could provide better value.\"If you don\'t want to go down that road, a tracker fund is for you.\"The effect of inflation means that any figure below £12, 538 indicates your investment has lost value in real terms. Should I buy an equity income fund? Assessing the relative performance of equity income funds depends on the timescale you take. Over the last decade, returns on the stock market as a whole have been slightly better than returns from equity income funds. Over the last 20 years though, the reverse is true. Either way, Hargreaves Lansdown advises investors to have at least some of their portfolios in equity income, even though they may not need a regular flow of cash. Francis Brooke agrees: \"We regard equity income investing as a good choice for retail investors - whether or not they need to spend their income.\"As ever, past performance is no guide to the future. Nevertheless the analysis of 10-year track records is amongst the best intelligence you\'re likely to get.',business

'Brexit: What would \'no deal\' look like? Negotiations to uncouple Britain from the European Union are about to begin, with Theresa May warning the UK will not accept a \"punitive deal\". The prime minister says leaving the 28 nation organisation with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. But the government has not done a thorough economic assessment of the \"no deal\" scenario, Brexit Secretary David Davis has admitted to MPs. Ministers say this outcome is unlikely, but do we have any idea what it would look like? The Brexit menu There are three different kinds of deal being discussed at the moment in Westminster and Brussels. This is the exit agreement mentioned in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which must be concluded within two years and can be extended only if all member countries agree they want more time. The talks are expected to cover technical issues like outstanding payments and the relocation of EU agencies based in the UK. It is not yet clear whether trade will feature in the Article 50 talks. The UK government wants this to be the case, but EU representatives have suggested separate talks may be necessary. So there could well be a separate trade agreement. The UK government wants everything to be sorted out by March 2019, when the two-year Article 50 process comes to an end and the UK leaves the EU. But the government says phasing in new arrangements could take time. \"People don\'t want a cliff-edge,\" Theresa May has said. Therefore she has suggested the possibility of \"a phased process of implementation\". Such a transition deal could be put into place in addition to, or as part of, any divorce deal and trade deal. A new dawn? If the UK walks away from the Article 50 negotiations, both a trade deal and transitional agreement would likely be off the table, at least in the short term. If that happens, the UK would automatically exit the EU at the end of the two-year negotiating deadline set out in Article 50. As the sun dawns on Brexit Britain in March 2019, major changes would immediately kick in. So what would be the main areas affected? Red tape At the moment the UK is part of the EU\'s single market, meaning goods and services are traded across the Channel without barriers or paperwork. This arrangement will come to an end in March 2019 when the two year Article 50 window closes. If the UK doesn\'t fix a new trade agreement with the EU, trade would fall back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, the government says. Under WTO rules, which were set up to facilitate global trade, a country must give the same degree of market access to all WTO members as it gives to its \"most favoured nation\". In other words there can be no special favours in the absence of a proper trade deal. The UK trades with lots of countries under WTO rules. But the terms are far less favourable than trading within the single market, which is almost frictionless. The sudden imposition of WTO rules is likely to mean tariffs and customs checks, leading to increased financial and bureaucratic costs for British firms buying and selling goods from abroad. Trucks could line up at the border, with customs agents making sure tariffs are imposed. The government says trade would not have to fall back onto \"pure\" WTO rules in a no deal scenario, because other less substantive agreements could help simplify trade.\"There are always relationships between major economies. Even in a non-outcome, I would expect some arrangements to be made,\" said Brexit Secretary David Davis before a parliamentary committee, although he didn\'t elaborate on what they could be. Whichever other arrangements would come into play supplementing WTO rules, some fear trade will take a hit in the immediate aftermath of the Article 50 window closing with no deal in place. Others argue it will be fine because EU nations would not want to risk a trade war with the UK, which is a big market for their products. Sorting passporting Many existing international trade arrangements, including WTO rules, are mainly concerned with the trade in goods. But services, especially finance, makes up a big chunk of the UK economy. The City of London is the biggest financial hub in Europe and British companies operate extensively on the continent, thanks in part to the EU single market. A no deal scenario could have a serious impact on financial services. A crucial issue is \'passporting\': membership of the EU\'s single market allows businesses in one member state to sell their financial services across the single market, instead of having to obtain licences in each individual country. These rights would cease to exist under a no deal scenario, according to . If such an outcome looked likely in the run-up to the Article 50 deadline, financial firms might set up subsidiaries in the EU, getting around the passporting issue in advance. Another option would be to agree on regulatory \"equivalence\" between the UK and the EU, but that too would have to be negotiated. In a pure \"no-deal\" scenario the flow of trade in financial services seems likely to take a hit, at least in the short term. Some Brexit supporters have argued that this threat has been overblown and it would not be in the interests of Germany and other financial centres to end arrangements that also work in their favour. Even if the UK\'s financial services passport is revoked, they add, external countries with the same financial framework as the EU, which would include the UK, are free to sell services to it. The Irish border UK ministers say they want to maintain as \"seamless and frictionless a border as possible\" with Ireland, a wish shared by their counterparts in Dublin. The UK and Ireland have a common travel area which pre-dates either country\'s EU membership. Brexit Secretary David Davis has described the continuation of this as \"non-negotiable\". Many people live in the north and work in the south and vice versa. Goods and services go back and forth with no customs barriers. \"No deal\" would mean the UK, including Northern Ireland, leaving the EU\'s customs union. There could perhaps be some bilateral agreement between the UK and Ireland but this would be difficult to do independent of the EU. A pure no deal scenario would mean a border between EU and a non-EU state, and thus the sudden imposition of tariffs and customs checks. Trade would likely slow down and there would be huge incentives for smuggling, according to a report by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs committee. It poses a hypothetical example: a Northern Irish farmer who exports meat and dairy to Ireland and other EU countries, tariff and paperwork free. In the event of an \"unplanned Brexit\", the farmer \"would face tariffs of between 30\% and 40\% on meat and dairy produce,\" which would make the farmer\'s goods uncompetitive. Checks at the border would be a huge bureaucratic exercise which would involve specialised computer systems and a lot of staff. Neither the UK, Ireland nor the EU wants hard borders and customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. But it is difficult to see how this could be avoided if no deal was reached. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major recently warned that a \"special deal\" would be needed to avoid jeopardising the peace process in Northern Ireland. The UK and Irish governments are co-guarantors of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which refers to both countries as \"partners in the European Union\".\"We are not going to do anything which might jeopardise the peace process,\" said David Davis on Wednesday. But Brexit, especially with no deal in place, may complicate an already intricate constitutional situation. Expats and holidaymakers What about the fate of EU citizens already living in the UK, and of UK citizens resident in other EU countries? According to ONS estimates, around 3. 2 million EU citizens live in the UK, and about 900, 000 Brits live in other EU countries. Both UK and EU officials have said that their post-Brexit status will be discussed early in the negotiations. According to the , without a deal or other residency rights, their entitlement to reside as EU nationals would disappear overnight. UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK could become third-country nationals, subject to domestic immigration rules. But the Commons committee report suggests in this area at least, the governments of the UK and individual EU countries could decide to guarantee citizens\' rights in the absence of a Brexit deal. Tourists may want to consider the likelihood of a no-deal breakup before booking a European holiday in March 2019. Although it is unlikely that they would require visas for their trips, \"some confusion at borders\" could be expected, the Commons report says. Emergency healthcare insurance for UK tourists in the EU could turn out to be a more tricky issue. On the day after a no-deal Brexit, UK travellers to the EU would lose emergency health coverage that comes with the European Health Insurance Cards (EHIC). Asked if British citizens would no longer have access to the EHIC health treatment in a no-deal scenario, Mr Davis said \"this is probably right\". The cost of breaking up Reports suggest the EU will hand the UK an exit bill of up to €60bn when it leaves. This is to cover the UK\'s share of outstanding EU budget commitments. The actual amount of the divorce bill will be subject to negotiations, but it could well be a particularly tricky part of the Brexit talks. Here, a no-deal Brexit might be good news for the UK government. Earlier this month, a House of Lords said that in the absence of an agreement, there would be no legal obligation for the UK to settle the Brexit bill. Of course the EU could try to take the UK to court. Exactly which court is unclear as the UK would no longer be under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. A legal battle over tens of billions of euros might sour UK-EU relations even further. How likely is no deal? The government has said parliament will get a vote on the Article 50 deal, though opposition MPs did not succeed in enshrining this promise in law.\"The vote will be either to accept the deal, or there will be no deal,\" said Brexit minister David Jones last month. This means a no deal scenario could arise in one of two ways: if the government does not negotiate one, or if it does but MPs vote it down. The government says it wants to negotiate an orderly exit under Article 50 within two years and get a comprehensive trade deal with the EU. In its , the government said it was confident \"a positive deal\" could be reached. EU leaders also seem eager to avoid a cliff-edge break up. European Council President Donald Tusk has said a \'no deal scenario\' would be \"bad for everyone, but above all for the UK, because it would leave a number of issues unresolved\". He said the EU wanted \"a smooth divorce and a good framework for the future\". Business groups have also weighed into the debate - the head of the Confederation of British Industry said leaving the EU without a deal would be \"irresponsible\". Ministers say it is unlikely, but Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select committee, there is \"a real possibility\" negotiations could break down over deeply contentious issues like the size of the divorce bill. The prime minister and Mr Davis have both insisted it would not be the worst possible outcome.',politics
'Row over US ISP customer data sales US politicians have voted to remove rules that demanded ISPs got permission from customers before selling their browsing histories. The US Senate voted by a narrow majority to repeal the rules that were first approved in October 2016. Politicians who called for the rules to be dropped said they were \"harmful\". The decision was called a \"crushing loss\" for privacy by digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).\'Gold mine\' The rules were drawn up when the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was overseen by a broadly democratic leadership. The requirements, which also covered the ways ISPs stopped data being stolen, were due to come into force by December 2017. The Trump presidency led to changes at the top of the FCC and prompted scrutiny of some of its decisions - including the broadband privacy provisions. Members of the US Senate who introduced the measure to overturn the FCC rules said they were \"overreaching\" and could \"stifle\" economic growth. ISPs and advertising groups had lobbied for the rules to be dropped. Current FCC chairman Ajit Pai, who was appointed by President Trump, said the rules threatened to confuse consumers as they were different to those imposed on web firms such as Google and Facebook. Following the decision by the Senate, the proposal now passes to the House of Representatives which has an overwhelming Republican majority and is likely to be approved. If the rules are dropped, US ISPs would be allowed to gather data on customers, their browsing histories, viewing habits, location and app usage. This package of data can then be sold to advertisers or marketing firms without letting customers know who is getting it or how it was gathered. Democrat Senator Bill Nelson, who wanted the rules to be approved, said the repeal of the rules would let ISPs amass a \"gold mine\" of data.\"They want to collect and use this information without providing transparency or being held accountable,\" The to contact their representatives to ask them to \"kill\" the proposal in the House. ISPs had \"incredible access\" to what people did online, it said. \"They shouldn\'t be able to profit off of the information about what you search for, read about, purchase, and more without your consent,\" it added.',tech

'What Next tells us about shopkeepers\' woes If you want a clear explanation of what\'s wrong with the retail sector, read Next\'s results statement. Not a recommendation you\'d hear very often, frankly, about most companies\' financial reporting. But rather than seeming designed to confuse and mislead, Next\'s report crisply spells out the challenges it\'s facing. And of course it\'s not just Next that\'s up against it, it\'s the High Street as a whole. A stark reminder of the difficulties came just yesterday when \"value\" shoe retailer Brantano went into administration, its pricier sister company Jones Bootmaker is up for sale. One of the administrators said the fall in the pound and a change in shopping habits were key factors. \'Asset or liability?\' Next\'s results reflect these trends in spades. Its annual profits have fallen for the first time in eight years and it doesn\'t seem in the mood to pull any punches. The most obvious challenge is the continuing gravitation to online shopping. Next Directory sales have been rising every year for the past 10. This time they rose by 4\% to £1. 7bn but sales in the stores - pretty much flat for the past 10 years - fell by nearly 3\% to £2. 3bn. It\'s still a significant chunk of business, and as Next points out in its statement, it\'s still opening new shops. However, it concedes that with increasing amounts of business being transferred online \"it is legitimate to question the long term viability of retail stores and whether the possession of a retail portfolio is an asset or a liability\". Drinks not dresses Its conclusion is that the stores are indeed \"valuable\" assets which will remain profitable \"even in very difficult circumstances\". Nevertheless it has painstakingly worked through a scenario of what would happen if retail sales continued to decline at \"high rates\" for the next decade, and it says the stores could be \"managed down profitably\". Another issue which leaps out from the pages of Next\'s statement is the change in what the UK consumer is prepared to spend money on. A new dress or pair of shoes is no longer the go-to quick fix of choice, it seems. Instead Next quotes Barclaycard figures which show the growth in spending on pubs, restaurants and entertainment, compared with High Street clothing in the last three months of 2016. \"We believe that these numbers demonstrate the continuing trend towards spending on experiences away from \'things\',\" says Next. \"Shifts in consumer spending patterns are not unusual and we expect that the trend will stabilise and reverse at some point,\" it continues. \'Continuing squeeze\' As if the fickleness of shoppers were not enough, of course, consumers have finally woken up to the fact that higher inflation means their money spreads more thinly. The fall in sterling since the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of imports for the likes of Next, although it says it doesn\'t expect price rises to be any worse in the second half of the year, and \"they may be a little better\". Nevertheless, it doesn\'t see inflationary pressures easing until the second half of next year. Meantime, it says, inflation is \"slowly rising to the level of general wages growth and look set to continue to do so for the remainder of the year, we therefore expect a continuing squeeze on real incomes in the year ahead\". Added to this Next has is own internal problems which it\'s dealing with, including taking its eye off the ball in terms of stocking its \"heartland\" products. That is \"easy to wear styles that can be delivered in large volumes and great prices across several colours\". Strength In short, Next reckons the year ahead looks \"tough\" with a \"combination of economic, cyclical and internal factors working against us\". But it\'s worth remembering this is not the first time Next - or retailers in general - have confronted such a mountain of adversity. Back at the start of the financial crisis in 2008, the number of retailers exiting the High Street seemed unstoppable. Woolworths went, and that was the last time Next saw profits drop. As chairman John Barton points out today \"by the following year our profits had started to grow again and our share price recovered strongly in the following years. \"I believe that by focusing on our core strengths as we did during 2008, we will see Next emerge from this period stronger than before\" he adds. Investors may well agree. Next\'s shares were up following the release of the results, and not just because they were a textbook example of how a company should get its message across. ',business
'The Great British Bake Off unveils new line-up Sandi Toksvig, food writer Prue Leith and comedian Noel Fielding will join Paul Hollywood when The Great British Bake Off returns in the autumn. Channel 4 announced the show\'s new line-up ahead of its first series since leaving the BBC.\"I could not be more delighted by who will be joining me on the show,\" said Hollywood, the only holdover from the BBC\'s version.

'Scottish independence: Holyrood to debate referendum call The Scottish Parliament is to start a two-day debate on whether to seek permission to hold a second independence referendum. The Scottish government wants to hold a referendum in the autumn of 2018 or the spring of the following year. But the Conservatives have calling for the parliament to rule out a referendum before April 2019. The UK is currently expected to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019. Scotland\'s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said last week that a referendum would need to be held before Brexit, \"or at least within a short time of it\", to prevent Scotland facing a \"lengthy period\" outside both the EU and the single market if it becomes independent. Her minority SNP government will ask MSPs to back its plans to ask Westminster for a section 30 order, which is needed to make a referendum legally binding. The government is expected to win Wednesday\'s vote with the support of the Scottish Greens. Prime Minister Theresa May said last week that for a referendum, insisting that the focus should instead be on getting the best deal for the whole of the UK during the forthcoming negotiations with the EU. Her comments were widely interpreted as suggesting she would block any attempt to hold a referendum before the UK leaves the European Union. But Mrs May, who will that the UK is leaving, did not rule out a vote on independence being held after Brexit. Her Scottish secretary, David Mundell, later clarified that the UK government \"will not be entering into discussions or negotiations about a Section 30 agreement\" during the Brexit talks, and that any request \"at this time\" will be declined. The Scottish government will now ask Holyrood to \"acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of government best suited to their needs\". The government motion asks MSPs for permission to \"take forward discussions\" with the UK government over a section 30. It says this would allow the Scottish Parliament to legislate for a referendum that will \"give the people of Scotland a choice over the future direction and governance of their country\". The motion says it would be for Holyrood to decide the timing and question for a referendum, and to set out who would be eligible to vote in it. It says the referendum would \"most appropriately\" be held between the autumn of 2018, when there is expected to be clarity over the outcome of the UK\'s Brexit negotiations, and the spring of the following year, when the UK is due to leave the EU. But Ms Sturgeon has indicated she of another vote with the prime minister. Analysis by Philip Sim, BBC Scotland political reporter The debate in parliament is likely to take on the air of an episode of Sportscene or Match of the Day where you already know the scores - we know who\'s going to win, but it will be interesting to see how the goals are scored. What will be important is what happens next - how the impasse between the Edinburgh and London governments is settled. Tellingly, the Conservative amendment for the debate calls for no vote \"before April 2019\" - a month which might just fit into Nicola Sturgeon\'s stated timetable, which included a period \"within a short time after\" Brexit is complete. But if Mr Mundell\'s position holds and the UK government spurns any discussion during the Brexit process, that could push back a potential referendum until sometime in 2020 at the earliest. Speaking ahead of the Holyrood debate, Ms Sturgeon said it would be \"democratically indefensible\" for the prime minister to block a referendum if the Scottish Parliament voted in favour of holding one. She added: \"The sovereign right of the people of Scotland to determine the form of government best suited to their needs is a longstanding and widely-accepted principle.\"A hard Brexit threatens huge economic and social damage to Scotland, and the people must have the opportunity to choose a different, better path.\" Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie confirmed his party would vote with the government, adding: \"The people of Scotland deserve to have a choice, and it\'s appalling to see anti-democratic Tories trying to close down our options\". But the Scottish Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats have all said they will vote against the motion. Tory leader Ruth Davidson said it was clear that a majority of people in Scotland do not want a re-run of the 2014 referendum, when voters rejected independence by 55\% to 45\%.\'Hiding the facts\' She added that it was \"utterly irresponsible\" for Ms Sturgeon to trigger a campaign \"while still hiding the facts on independence, such as the currency, EU membership and the price tag it would entail.\"Her party\'s amendment to the Scottish government motion calls on the parliament to reject the proposal for a referendum before April 2019. Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, who backs a federal solution for the UK, said the country did not need a repeat of the \"divisions\" of 2014, and claimed that Ms Sturgeon \"wakes up every single day thinking of ways to engineer another referendum because leaving the UK is the only thing that matters to her.\" Ms Dugdale also said the Scottish government had \"ignored the will\" of the Scottish Parliament on five occasions over the past year, when it had been defeated by opposition parties in votes over issues including fracking and the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act. And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said it was \"absurd for the SNP to put forward a referendum when there is no cast-iron guarantee that they will take Scotland back into the EU\".',politics
'Spear-phishing scammer demanded sex show Six weeks ago, a young woman called Zed (not her real name) was in a meeting at work when a message popped up on Facebook Messenger from a distant friend.\"Hey babe,\" it began. The friend asked Zed to vote for her in an online modelling competition, which she agreed to do. But then - disaster. Adding her email address to the competition register had caused a tech meltdown, her friend said. She needed to borrow her email log-in to fix it quickly and restore her votes. Zed was unsure. The friend begged - her career was at stake, she pleaded. Still in the meeting and powerless to make a call, Zed gave in - a momentary leap of faith. Except it was not her friend that she was talking to - someone else had got into the account and was pretending to be her. It\'s a scamming technique known as spear phishing. What is spear phishing? \"Phishing uses behavioural psychology to trick victims into trusting the attacker in order to obtain sensitive information,\" said Paul Bischoff of , who also talked to Zed. \"Spear phishing is less prevalent, but far more dangerous. Spear phishing targets an individual or small group of people. The attacker can gather personal information about their target to build a more believable persona.\"How do I protect myself? Besides never sharing the credentials for your online accounts, a good way to stay safe is to enable \"two-step authentication\". This means that users must enter another code besides their password, received for example by their mobile phone, to log in. This can usually be set up in the security settings for your account or during the sign-up process. Two-step authentication is offered by Gmail, Hotmail, Apple, Amazon, Yahoo, Facebook and Twitter . Within minutes, Zed watched in horror as she was locked out of one account after another, as well as her Apple iCloud where she stored all her data - including a photo of her passport, bank details, and some explicit pictures. The hacker took control of all her IDs as they were all linked to the email address details she had supplied. The scammer also activated an extra layer of security, called two-step authentication, meaning that they received all alerts about her accounts and could reset them. Then a man called. The number had a Pakistan area code. \"He started the call by saying he didn\'t want any drama, he didn\'t want me to cry, he wanted me to talk to him like a professional,\" she said. He sounded young, perhaps a college student, she thought. \'Immoral\' He accused her of leading an \"immoral\" life. He had seen her photographs, he knew she had smoked and had boyfriends and was sexually active. He asked her what her parents would think and was furious when she said they already knew.\"He claimed he had hacked thousands of women,\" Zed says.\"He said 10 or 12 he had felt bad about because he couldn\'t find anything about them that was \'wrong\'.\"Zed was not part of that group.\"He said he was happy when he hacked my account. That I deserved everything.\"He told her he would post the explicit pictures on her Facebook page - where she has more than 1, 000 friends. \"I offered him money. I asked if I could pay. He said, \'Don\'t talk about money.\' He sounded irritated,\" she said. Instead, he wanted her to perform a sex act for him on camera. Zed refused.\"Either you do it for me or you do it for the whole world,\" he told her - and uploaded one of the photos to Facebook. Zed had already warned her boyfriend and parents who assembled an army of friends waiting to report activity on her account. Within 15 minutes it had been disabled by Facebook - but she still received concerned messages from contacts.\"A friend who is like a brother sent me a message - it wasn\'t him who had seen [the photo] but a friend of his,\" she said.\"I feel like I mustn\'t think too much about how many people saw [the photos].\"The last thing the scammer said to her was, \"Have a great life.\"\"It seemed to me the only reason he was doing this was to morally police women and get them to do stuff for him,\" Zed said. \"He wanted a gallery of explicit photographs of women. That seemed to be his motive.\"Zed does not consider herself to be digitally naive. She is a bright, articulate 20-something from India who works in the media industry on the US east coast.\"I have been tech savvy and on the internet almost my entire life - but I\'ve never really seen the power of what people can do until now,\" she says. Regaining control of her accounts has been a struggle. It took Zed a month to get her Apple ID back after engineers created a bespoke questionnaire for her containing answers that were not stored in her account. Gmail and Facebook have also been restored, but she has lost Snapchat and her Hotmail address - her central account which she had used for more than 13 years. \'Chink in the armour\' \"I feel for the poor woman - these scams are so easy to fall for,\" said cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University.\"I think what it shows is that security is a combination of people, process and technology. You can be very \'savvy\' in any one or two of these but scammers are superb at finding novel combinations that, frankly, we just wouldn\'t think of. \"I know it sounds so obvious but, regardless of who they are, you should not share your username and password. Give these scammers a small chink in the armour and they are sadly brilliant at getting in and running amok in your digital life.\"Zed still uses iCloud but does not store personal stuff on it anymore - and has activated two-step verification everywhere. \"I still see the value in the storage. But I will never ever give any information away again,\" she said. Zed originally decided to share her story on community site Reddit after trying to find others who may have been conned by the same man.\"I was really shocked to discover that I found absolutely nothing,\" she said.\"I was hoping that speaking up about it would remedy that problem and encourage others to share their stories.\"It also felt like the only way to get back at him.\"As far as Zed knows, the scammer has not been caught.\"Cyber-criminals come in all shapes and sizes,\' said prof Woodward. \"Their motive is not always monetary gain. As we have sadly seen of late, revenge or just being plain malicious is a growing trend.\" ',tech

'How can we make business travel less stressful? Travelling for business may sound glamorous, but it can actually be pretty stressful. Booking tickets and hotels, co-ordinating journey times, coping with queues and scrums for taxis, can all leave you frazzled before you\'ve even entered the room to make your pitch. Booking. com research finds that more than nine in 10 business travellers suffer from stress. So wouldn\'t it be wonderful if technology could take a lot of these hassles away? From and room service at the touch of a button, to , tech innovations promise to do just that. But it could be artificial intelligence (AI) that has the biggest impact. Felicia Schneiderhan\'s New York-based company 30SecondsToFly developed \"Claire\": an artificially intelligent (AI) travel assistant designed to take the stress out of booking your next trip, which launches later this year.\"Claire allows companies to automate travel management in a cost-effective manner, even if their annual travel budget is on the lower end,\" she says. The travel bot uses companies\' travel policies and employees\' travel preferences to create \"smart itineraries\". Employees can talk to it via Slack, Facebook, SMS and Skype.\"Say the user messages Claire saying \'NY to SF, next Friday, to land before 7pm\',\" Ms Schneiderhan says. \"Claire asks \'Do you want a return flight?\' then provides a set of two to three options that the traveller can book instantly, as Claire has their personal information and payment details saved.\"Two kinds of AI are required for Claire to do this: natural language processing to converse with the traveller as another human being would, and a trip selection algorithm that personalises the booking experience within the employer\'s policy constraints. \"Users will be able to book and access basic travel analytics free of charge,\" Ms Schneiderhan adds.\"The cost of advanced features, such as software integrations, will depend on the volume of bookings made.\"Paul Erickson, senior analyst at IHS Markit, believes virtual assistants will soon play a significant role in business travel reservations.\"Virtual assistants can save end users one or many steps in lots of everyday tasks, including booking business travel,\" he says.\"However, there will still be unique situations, such as ad hoc problem solving, that are likely to require human interaction.\"Calm down Booking travel may become easier, but travelling itself can still be tiring and stressful. So how about trying doppel, the world\'s first \"mood-changing\" wristband? It emits a gentle, rhythmic vibration you can control using an app on your phone - making it faster to help you feel more alert, and slowing it down to relax. And while a wristband that can alter your mood might sound far-fetched, it has been shown to improve focus and reduce stress in controlled scientific studies run by Royal Holloway University, London. Doppel co-founder Jack Hooper believes the wristbands could even help counteract the effects of jet lag after a long flight.\"Our technology has been independently shown to improve focus as well as significantly reduce stress,\" he says.\"So you could, for example, use doppel to feel calmer on a flight or stay alert during a long meeting. \"It won\'t eliminate jet lag, but it will help you to stay focused during the day and then wind down in the evening.\"The wristbands should be available in March retailing at $179 (£144). Social dining Business trips are notorious for leaving travellers with time to kill between meetings and flights. And it\'s quite dispiriting always having to ask for a \"table-for-one\" at a restaurant. Well don\'t worry. There\'s an app for that. Dubbed \"Tinder for professionals\", location-based networking app DineHero was conceived after founder Thet Soe got sick of eating alone while away on business.\"I thought, I eat every day, so if I can get to know one or two people while I eat, my network will grow much faster.\"Launched in October 2016, the app allows users to set up shared meals with up to four participants, and to view local dining events they could attend.\"You can invite specific people based on their job and education details, or simply leave the event open and see who turns up,\" Mr Soe says. DineHero operates a points system whereby you earn credit for attending or setting up events and spend points when you invite specific users. Using Google and Yelp, members find people to dine with via the app\'s \"radar invite\" feature.\"At the moment, the biggest DineHero community is in Chicago,\" Mr Soe says. \"But it can be used anywhere where you can use Google or Yelp and there are already member communities in 25 different countries.\"Do you have a receipt? Coming back from a business trip doesn\'t mean an end to the stress, though - there are all the fiddly expenses to claim and account for. New travel expenses app TravelBank helps workers book trips and file claims more efficiently, and allows employers to offer incentives for coming in under budget. TravelBank chief executive Duke Chung says: \"Many companies are still using clunky expense reporting methods that don\'t hold employees to a budget or allow them to forecast spend accurately. \"With TravelBank, they can control spending while rewarding budget-conscious employees.\" Aimed at small-to-medium-sized companies, the free-to-use app uses online sources and partnerships to pull in pricing information on everything from flights to car rental. It then creates a budget for the trip and enables employees to file expenses and track spending as they go.\"Businesses using just these features can cut travel and entertainment spending by about 15\%, while those that reward employees for coming in under budget typically see greater savings, upwards of 30\%,\" Mr Chung says. IHS Insight\'s Mr Erickson believes that the basic functions of billing, expensing, and management can \"mostly be offloaded to some sort of AI-driven bot\". Of course, videoconferencing tech was meant to reduce much of the need for business travel, but it seems we humans still prefer meeting face-to-face.

'Labour MP Gerald Kaufman dies at 86 Sir Gerald Kaufman, Labour MP for Manchester Gorton and Father of the House of Commons, has died aged 86. His family made the announcement late on Sunday, calling him \"a great socialist and parliamentarian\". Sir Gerald, who was the oldest serving MP, famously called his party\'s left-wing 1983 election manifesto \"the longest suicide note in history\". Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn led tributes to him, calling him an \"iconic and irascible figure\". Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: \"There was no one quite like Gerald Kaufman: a brilliant speaker, a compelling writer, an acerbic wit and a conscientious constituency MP. \"With his sharp insights, he not only penned many famous lines but gave the wisest of advice to Labour leaders who relied upon him throughout his 47 years in Westminster.\"Tony Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said: \"Gerald was an extraordinary man, passionate, principled, acerbic and absolutely dedicated to the cause of social justice and the Labour Party.\"A family spokesman confirmed he had been suffering from a long-term illness.\'Committed\' MP Prime Minister Theresa May said she had been \"very sad\" to learn of Sir Gerald\'s death.\"His was a life of remarkable commitment to his constituents in Manchester and to the political life of the nation... as Father of the House (a title taken by the longest serving MP) his wisdom and experience will be very much missed by MPs on all sides of the House.\"Sir Gerald became an MP in north-west England in 1970, first for the Manchester Ardwick constituency and then for Manchester Gorton, which he had served since 1983. He was a junior minister between 1974 and 1979, and held a number of senior shadow cabinet posts through the 1980s, before returning to the backbenches in the early 1990s. A family spokesman said: \"Sir Gerald dedicated his life to serving those who he believed would benefit most from a Labour government and Labour values in action. \"He believed that policy and principle without power were simply not enough to deliver the better life that he fought for on behalf of his constituents for almost 50 years.\"[Throughout his illness], he remained firmly committed to, and focused on, the activities and wellbeing of his beloved constituency.\"\'Persistent interrogator\' Gerald Kaufman rose from a working-class background to become one of the longest-serving MPs of his generation. He gained a reputation as a persistent, often waspish, interrogator whose withering putdowns became a feature of his time in Parliament. A practising Jew, he was best known for his fierce opposition to the policies of the Israeli government and its treatment of the Palestinians. Possessed of a sardonic wit, he was a prolific writer and columnist who also wrote satirical sketches for the BBC, an organisation that he later frequently criticised. Sir Gerald was a member of the Jewish Labour Movement and was known for his criticism of Israel, calling senior politicians from the country \"war criminals\" in 2002. Mr Corbyn said: \"Gerald came from a proud Jewish background. He always wanted to bring peace to the Middle East and it was my pleasure to travel with him to many countries.\"He loved life and politics. I will deeply miss him, both for his political commitment and constant friendship.\"Former leader Ed Miliband said he was \"an outstanding servant of the Labour movement\", adding: \"His principles, values and friendship will be sorely missed.\" Tributes from across the political spectrum have been paid to Sir Gerald. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell tweeted: \"Sad to hear of Gerald Kaufman\'s death. He was a tremendously dedicated servant of his constituency and our party. A man of absolute principle.\"Commons Speaker John Bercow called him an \"outstanding representative\" and a \"passionate campaigner for social justice, here in Britain and around the world\". Former Labour shadow minister Chuka Umunna tweeted: \"Very sad to hear of Sir Gerald\'s death. A true Labour man and one of the most eloquent parliamentarians. Thoughts are with his family.\"Conservative MP Michelle Donelan MP said: \"So sad to hear that Sir Gerald Kaufman MP for Manchester Gorton and Father of The House of Commons, has passed away.\"And Tory MP Peter Heaton-Jones tweeted: \"Sad to hear that Sir Gerald Kaufman, Father of the House of Commons, has died.

'Has wearable tech had its day? With the clicking of poles and a determined stride, the Winchester Nordic Walking group is a distinctive sight as its members pound the Hampshire countryside. The day I bumped into them, all but one was using some form of fitness tracker. A few Fitbits, a Garmin smartwatch, a couple of phone apps and one basic pedometer - and all, they claimed, were roughly counting the same paces.\"Before I had a watch it didn\'t bother me, now I\'ve got one I hate being without it,\" said group leader Linda Bidder. Christiane Livingstone oversees Nordic walking groups around the UK. \"Fitness trackers (of all sorts) are incredibly popular in my groups,\" she said.\"People love to know how far they have walked and even compete with each other.\"And yet the wearables market has had a rollercoaster ride in recent months. This time last year analysts were making multi-billion dollar forecasts for the developers of health trackers and smartwatches, and Apple was boldly selling a $10, 000 gold edition of the Apple Watch. But by November 2016 , according to a report by market analysts IDC. Jawbone, once a popular fitness tracker brand, that it is leaving the consumer market and focusing on healthcare providers. Microsoft has removed its Fitness Band on its online store (although it is still available on retail giant Amazon) and crucially Fitbit remains a key brand name at the heart of the fitness tracker revolution - and it acquired one of its rivals, the Pebble Watch - but it was recently reported to be laying off staff, and founder James Park said the firm experienced . 10, 000 steps Various devices claim to measure heart rate, sleep, activity and count calories. Counting steps is probably the most common use of wearable devices - but recently experts have questioned , and a US study concluded that Analyst Ben Wood, from CCS Insight, was such a wearables enthusiast that he still wears one on each wrist - but even he speaks more cautiously these days about the sector overall.\"The reality is these devices have stalled in the marketplace,\" he told BBC Radio 4\'s You and Yours programme.\"A lot of people have got them, a lot of people like them but the spectacular explosive growth that we anticipated hasn\'t really occurred.\" Ben Wood thinks there\'s an engagement issue - after a while these devices don\'t tell you anything new. There\'s also the battery issue, and the fact that many of the older and cheaper varieties aren\'t water resistant. Furthermore, Simon Bryant from Futuresource says many wearables aren\'t yet independent enough and rely on being tethered to a smartphone, or replicate a functionality, such as step counting, that the handset already has. However Mr Bryant believes that while wearables may be down, they are not yet out.\"We feel the slowdown is temporary and the market will accelerate this year,\" he said. He thinks that improved power, appearance, and mobile pay options could give them a boost alongside a maturing user group. Things do appear to be looking up. indicate 25\% market growth year-on-year, with Fitbit taking the largest share - followed by budget brand Xiaomi. One of the top five sellers is Garmin, which has focused on the dedicated fitness market. Theo Axford, senior product marketing manager at Garmin UK, told the BBC that while the market had become \"very competitive\" the firm had not experienced declining sales.\"Brands must ensure that they are meeting the needs of the customer and always delivering value,\" he said. \"Whilst the entry space has become largely commoditised, customers that have bought into the technology as a first foray into wearables are now looking for, and demanding more.\"The advocacy we\'ve experienced for our devices over many years in what was a fairly specialist market has now become much more mainstream, and customers are looking for a brand with the specialist expertise and a legacy they can trust.\"And what about smartwatches - once feted as the ultimate smartphone accessory with multiple tracking functions and apps? Ben Wood argues that they are \"a solution that\'s looking for a problem\" - but robust sales of the Apple Watch and Google\'s current rollout of a new operating source for Android-powered watches, Android Wear 2. 0, suggest the industry has not given up on them yet. In December 2016 following the release of the Apple Watch 2 in September, and Android watchmaker Samsung showed the biggest growth year-on-year in IDC\'s report. \"The smart wearables market is changing,\" said Ramos Llamas from IDC.\"Health and fitness remains a major focus, but once these devices become connected to a cellular network, expect unique applications and communications capabilities to become available.\"And this will allow them to make a bid for freedom, he believes.\"This will also solve another key issue: freeing the device from the smartphone, creating a stand-alone experience.\"',tech

'Waitrose coffee change gives grounds for complaint We have long known there is no such thing as a free lunch, but now it seems there is no such thing as a free coffee either. Waitrose is changing its offer for loyalty card members so they will have to buy something before being able to claim a \"free tea or coffee\" in store. The supermarket said it was just a \"refinement\" of the existing policy. But it has provoked mock outrage on social media from some of the chain\'s loyal shoppers. As one Twitter user put it: \"A collective gasp from middle England as @waitrose announces you now have to *buy something* before indulging in free teas and coffees.\" Another joked: \"We will speak of this day for years to come. Social historians will trace the #Islington #Coffee #Riots to this act of betrayal!\" The offer of a free hot beverage for myWaitrose members has not been without controversy. In 2014, Labour raised concerns about the promotion, claiming it was hurting independent traders nearby. The prime minister at the time, David Cameron, also gave his views on the issue, saying he could not see why people were complaining about it.\'Just a refinement\' A spokeswoman for the supermarket said the new policy was \"just a refinement\" for its customers.\"From 3 April, we\'ll simply be asking myWaitrose members to make a purchase before collecting their cup at the checkout,\" the company said in an email to myWaitrose members. Waitrose started to try out the new approach in 15 stores last year, and now it has decided to roll out the policy nationwide. But for those who might have been sneaking in the odd free cup of coffee, there is some good news. The supermarket said there would be no minimum spend to claim the hot drink.\"A free tea or coffee has always been one of the ways we thank our customers for shopping with us - and that has not changed - we are underlining our commitment to this much-loved offer,\" the supermarket\'s spokeswoman said. What else used to be free? Plastic bags The obvious one. From October 2015, shoppers started being charged 5p for every new plastic bag they used at large stores in England. The charge provoked fury, and bag-hoarding, among some shoppers at the time. But official figures have suggested it has been effective. The number of single-use plastic bags used by shoppers in England plummeted by more than 85\% in the first six months, according to the government. Meals on flights Before Easyjet and Ryanair rewrote the rules on short-haul air travel, passengers could take their free drink and snack for granted. But in January this year, British Airways signalled that era was well and truly over when it ended the practice on its shorter flights. Customers on its domestic and European flights now have to pay for food and drinks from an on-board menu. Air At petrol stations, at least, air is no longer free. Drivers need to pay a small charge to fill up their tyres. The charge has been around for a while, but Tesco angered some drivers last year, when it increased the minimum price to use the pumps from 20p to 50p. The supermarket says it re-invests the revenue to ensure that the air machines are working correctly.',business
'TV listings: The battle over your programme guide Viewers may have trouble finding shows they love if public service channels are not guaranteed top positions on TV guides, major broadcasters have warned. Peers are currently debating a change to the law which says channels including BBC One, ITV and Channel 4 must appear top of on-screen listings. Major broadcasters argue public service channels should be protected as people adopt more personalised viewing habits. But Sky says the networks are acting in \"blatant self-interest\". The says that with users \"increasingly able to personalise their own homepage for on-demand services, it would not be in their interests to legislate against this progress\". James Purnell, the BBC\'s director of radio and education, wrote in the that \"sensible action\" needed to be taken, or \"we\'re at serious risk of losing something very special about our British culture\". The House of Lords is debating whether there should be an amendment to the Digital Economy Bill, to protect the place of public service broadcasters (PSBs). Here\'s what the main players say: argues that new set-top boxes offer limited options on their homepages - which means there\'s no space for on-demand services from public service broadcasters like iPlayer, ITV Hub and All4. Mr Purnell said: \"Some pay-TV platforms are already making \'free to air\' services harder to find. There\'s no point being top of the programme guide if it\'s difficult to find the guide.\"This isn\'t about forcing people to watch public service programmes, or stopping viewers watching American shows we love. It\'s about making sure you can find them easily.\"He also points out that in channel listings on Sky, the BBC\'s children\'s channels, CBeebies and CBBC - which he describes as \"safe, trusted, educational, British programmes without adverts\" - are below a dozen US cartoon networks. says the prominence of PSBs on electronic programme guides (EPGs) \"needs to be preserved\".

The Sky statement continued: \"On Sky Q, for example, they will not allow us to promote their shows on our home page. And on the SkyGo and Sky Q mobile app, the BBC has refused to grant Sky the rights to show any content whatsoever.\"The BBC needs to get with the times and allow consumers to view content they have already paid for alongside the content of other PSBs and commercial broadcasters.\" says BBC content is already prominent on its platform, the EPG is accessible via a button on its remote, and BBC on-demand content is \"easily found\".

'Watson warns minister over George Osborne\'s editor role Labour\'s deputy leader has warned Digital Minister Matt Hancock to avoid any conflict of interests in his future dealings with ex-chancellor George Osborne, now Evening Standard editor. Tom Watson said Mr Osborne would be expected to seek to influence ministers on media policy in his new role, and urged Mr Hancock to excuse himself from any matters relating to the Standard. Mr Osborne has faced calls to quit as an MP after he accepted the editorship. But he insists he can do both jobs. In a letter to the minister of state for digital and culture, Mr Watson pointed to the long-standing personal and professional relationship Mr Hancock had enjoyed with Mr Osborne. \"It is a matter of public record that your first job in politics, in 2005, was as an economic advisor to Mr Osborne, who was then the shadow chancellor,\" he wrote.\"You later became Mr Osborne\'s chief of staff. These roles and the contacts you will have made through holding them, were no doubt helpful to you as you successfully sought selection as Conservative parliamentary candidate for West Suffolk, the constituency you have represented as an MP since 2010.\"Mr Watson stressed that there was \"no secret, and no shame, in a Conservative MP being a loyal ally of his former boss and powerful patron\" - but he warned that as a minister he will now have responsibility for policy areas in which Mr Osborne and his new employer have a commercial interest. He argued that, as the Standard\'s editor, Mr Osborne \"can be expected to seek to influence ministers on media policy in line with his views and the views of his paper\'s proprietor Mr Alexander Lebedev, both in the pages of the newspaper and in meetings with ministers.\"You would be one of the chief targets of any such attempts to influence media policy,\" he said.\"Your long-standing relationship with Mr Osborne means that any ministerial decisions you make from now on which affect media policy will be subject to accusations of a conflict of interest which it will be difficult for you to disprove.\"Mr Osborne\'s new job has caused controversy after he said he intends to combine the editorship role with that of representing his Cheshire constituency of Tatton - 190 miles from the capital. But in an open letter to his constituents, Mr Osborne said: \"There is a long tradition of politics and journalism mixing.

'John McDonnell says \'soft coup\' launched against Corbyn Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says \"a soft coup\" has been launched against Jeremy Corbyn by \"elements in the Labour Party\". Mr McDonnell accuses unnamed \"plotters\" and the \"Murdoch media empire\" of a \"coordinated and fully resourced\" coup. In an , he said \"the plotters\" were using \"an exceptionally well resourced dark arts operation\" to \"destroy Jeremy Corbyn\". One former Labour minister described Mr McDonnell\'s comments as \"unhinged\". In his article, Mr McDonnell accuses \"the coup perpetrators\" of \"a covert strategy\" to destabilise Mr Corbyn because they had failed to dislodge him directly through a leadership election. He said their tactics included \"daily and constant behind-the-scenes non-attributable briefings against Jeremy\". It is understood the article by Mr McDonnell was written before Labour\'s Copeland by-election loss but posted on the Labour Briefing website on Sunday night.\'Scale of task\' A spokesman for Mr McDonnell said: \"This article was written over a week ago in response to the intervention from Tony Blair. \"It was published in print last week and only went online last night. \"However, as John said yesterday, he wants us all to focus on party unity following last week\'s by-election results. \"And he is looking to reach out in the coming days to those across all sections of the party and none.\" Mr Corbyn, from the left of the party, was the overwhelming winner of Labour\'s leadership election in 2015, despite having the support of only a small number of the party\'s MPs. A challenge to him last year led to another vote of all Labour Party members and affiliated supporters, which he again won overwhelmingly. But many of the party\'s MPs have continued to be unhappy with his leadership, and the party trails the Conservatives in opinion polls. Labour MPs vent anger At Monday night\'s Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) meeting, some MPs criticised Jeremy Corbyn\'s non-attendance, with one telling the BBC they would raise the Copeland defeat each week until the leader addressed it. A party spokesman said Mr Corbyn had given his apologies for being unable to make the meeting and didn\'t attend every time. Andrew Gwynne - the joint elections co-ordinator (with Ian Lavery) - oversaw the Copeland campaign and was supportively shouted down by MPs when he suggested taking responsibility for the defeat himself. He was applauded for praising local activists and the neighbouring MP John Woodcock - a long-standing opponent of Jeremy Corbyn - for their efforts in the campaign. He also said he looked forward to working with the PLP on the forthcoming local elections - the main issues would be health, housing and jobs. Sources at the meeting suggested one of the more amusing questions came from former shadow transport secretary Lilian Greenwood, who read out a long list of reasons given over the weekend by party spokespeople for the loss of Copeland, and which hadn\'t included the party leadership. She then asked: \"Have I left anything off that list?\"Some MPs were critical of shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti, who had outlined some of those reasons on television over the weekend but who hadn\'t attended the PLP. A picture of her drinking with shadow home secretary Diane Abbott in the nearby Pugin room while the meeting was taking place had been tweeted and was raised by MP Neil Coyle. One MP told reporters: \"Shami had a lot to say at the weekend. It\'s a shame she had nothing to say at the meeting.\"On Sunday, Mr Corbyn said Labour\'s by-election loss showed \"the scale of how hard our task is to persuade people of our message\". In a speech, he urged his party to \"remain united\" and not to \"give up\". Labour lost the seat of Copeland, in Cumbria, to the Conservatives last week - the first by-election gain by a governing party in 35 years. However, Labour managed to hold off a challenge from UKIP in a by-election, in Stoke-on-Trent Central, on Thursday. Questioned about his future after the speech, Mr Corbyn said: \"I\'m carrying on as leader because I\'m determined that we will deliver social justice in this country.\"Asked if he would still be in place in 2020, when the next general election is expected to take place, he replied: \"I\'ve given you a very, very clear answer - yes.\" ',politics
'Nokia 3310 mobile phone resurrected at MWC 2017 Nokia\'s 3310 phone has been relaunched nearly 17 years after its debut.

The revamped version will be sold under licence by the Finnish start-up HMD Global, which also unveiled several Nokia-branded Android smartphones. One expert said it was a \"fantastic way\" to relaunch Nokia\'s phone brand.\"The 3310 was the first mass-market mobile and there\'s a massive amount of nostalgia and affection for it,\" commented Ben Wood from the technology consultancy CCS Insight. \"If HMD had just announced three Android devices they would have barely got a couple of column inches in the press.\"So, the 3310 is a very clever move and we expect it will sell in significant volumes.\" The announcement was made ahead of the start of the Mobile World Congress tech show in Barcelona. and Lenovo are among others to have unveiled new devices. Nokia no longer makes phones itself, but manufactures telecoms equipment, Ozo virtual reality cameras, and health kit under the Withings brand. Long life The new 3310 qualifies as a \"feature phone\" rather than a smartphone as it only provides limited internet facilities. It relies on 2. 5G connectivity - which has slower data speeds than 3G or 4G - and is powered by the S30+ operating system, which allows web browsing but has a much smaller range of apps than Android or iOS. Its single camera is also restricted to two megapixels. However, its advantage over more powerful handsets is its battery life. HMD says the colour-screened phone has up to a month\'s standby time and delivers more than 22 hours of talk time. It also comes with the modern version of the classic game Snake preinstalled. Its launch price is €49 ($51, 75; £41. 51). \"It\'s almost like a digital detox or a holiday phone,\" HMD\'s chief executive Arto Nummela told the BBC.\"If you want to switch off to an extent but you still need to have a [mobile] lifeline, it\'s a brilliant solution.\"Why wouldn\'t you buy this like candy? If you see this hanging on the shelf at the checkout in a [see-through] package, then you\'d just buy it as an accessory.\" More from MWC 2017: HMD also confirmed the Nokia 6 Android smartphone would be released worldwide following its . The device has a 16 megapixel rear camera, a 5. 5in (14cm) 1080p \"full definition\" screen and includes the Google Assistant helper - the search engine\'s rival to Apple\'s Siri. It is priced as a mid-tier device at €229, alongside a glossy black special edition that costs €299. In addition, the firm showed off smaller, lower-range Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 models. Taiwan\'s Foxconn will manufacture the phones, which may offset concerns that networks might have about HMD\'s capacity to deliver.\"Foxconn - with its experience working with Apple and Samsung - is certainly the standout device manufacturer,\" commented Tim Coulling from the tech research firm Canalys.\"It\'s ability to help HMD go from small to large scale will be a critical factor in their partnership. \"It also means if HMD wants to locate manufacturing in different regions to take advantage of pockets of demand, that\'s something Foxconn will allow them to achieve.\" However, another market watcher said HMD\'s success was far from guaranteed.\"Resurrecting one of Nokia\'s feature phone bestsellers seems like a good beachhead to attack the smartphone market.\"But another part of Nokia\'s heritage was its high-end devices. \"What HMD needs next is a higher-end [Android smartphone] that is different, and that\'s always a problem with Android: how do you differentiate? \"Nokia\'s brand will get them so far - especially in emerging markets - but trying to push into the high-end versus Apple, Samsung or even Huawei will be tough.\"Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent There is no doubt what the headlines will be from the HMD Global Nokia event here in Barcelona - and they won\'t be about a new range of slick Android smartphones. Yes, the reboot of the Nokia 3310 is fun - and perhaps there is a huge audience for a return to a time when all you could do with a phone was make calls and play Snake. But make no mistake, if this piece of nostalgia is the future of the Nokia brand then it is doomed. And of course the smart team at HMD Global know that. They haven\'t built partnerships with Foxconn, Google and hundreds of operators around the world on the promise of a return to the 2G past. It is phones like the Nokia 6 - apparently already selling well in China - which are key to any hopes of making the Finnish brand a force to be reckoned with again. But of course yet another slab of metal and glass running Android was never going to excite the analysts and journalists tired of overblown launches where the words \"awesome\" and \"revolutionary\" are thrown around like confetti. Hence the decision to remind us of Nokia\'s glorious past, where everyone seemed to have a phone with that familiar ringtone and nobody was asking to borrow a charger to get them through the day. A stroke of marketing genius then - but a risky strategy. If the phone-buying public one now sees Nokia as a retro brand rather one which has been reinvigorated for the 4 and 5G future, then HMD may come to regret its 3310 gimmick.',tech
'Aaron Ramsey: Chris Gunter defends teammate from Arsenal fan criticism Chris Gunter has defended his Wales team-mate Aaron Ramsey following criticism from Arsenal fans. Midfielder Ramsey has been jeered by Gunners supporters and singled out by disgruntled celebrity followers such as Piers Morgan during the club\'s recent poor form. But Gunter, who was Ramsey\'s best man at his wedding, believes his friend will be unaffected by the vitriol. \"He is fine, it\'s not something that bothers him,\" said Gunter. \"He doesn\'t need to prove himself to anyone, and the stuff wouldn\'t bother Aaron because you find out very quickly in football who to listen to.\"The only people you need to impress are your team-mates and your manager and everything else going around it, you take and it changes every week. \"Piers Morgan is not in football, is he? \"Anybody like that you have to separate, especially in this day and age with social media everybody wants followers, views, likes and this type of stuff and how much is somebody like that just doing it for the attention? \"For Aaron it doesn\'t bother me because we all get stick at certain times.

Still only 27 years old, the Reading full-back has been tipped to become the first Welshman to win 100 caps, which would take him past Neville Southall and Gary Speed at the top of the charts.\"It\'s fantastic. Before you get your first one or two you never think years down the line,\" Gunter said.\"If you had said to me on the day of the first cap I would go onto equal or go past certain players I would never think that. It\'s a massive honour to be ahead of a lot of players that I remember watching on TV. \"But that feeling when you are in the line-up and the anthem is being played is a feeling you don\'t get anywhere else in football. There\'s nothing you can get for that.\"To do it once is special. To do it repeatedly over and over is something I never take for granted.\"You never like to look back in football. I\'m sure the day I have played my last game for Wales will be one I look back with massive pride.\"',sport
'Higher fuel prices take toll on retail sales UK retail sales posted a 1. 4\% rise in February from the previous month, but there are signs that higher fuel prices have begun to hit shoppers\' pockets. In the three months to February, sales volumes fell by 1. 4\%, a sharper slide than the 0. 5\% decline for the three months to January. That was the biggest three-month fall recorded by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) since March 2010. Fuel prices in February were 18. 7\% higher than a year earlier.\"February\'s retail sales figures show fairly strong growth, though the underlying three-month picture shows falling sales as February\'s figures follow two consecutive months of decline in December and January,\" said ONS statistician Kate Davies. \"The underlying trend suggests that rising petrol prices in particular have had a negative effect on the overall quantity of goods bought over the last three months.\"Petrol cost an average of 120p a litre in February, with diesel 3p more, according to ONS figures.

'Sir Paul McCartney on Lennon, Kanye and his own musical legacy Sir Paul McCartney\'s final album of the \'80s, Flowers in the Dirt, is regarded as one of his best of the decade. He teamed up with new musicians, new producers and a new songwriting partner in the form of Elvis Costello and it inspired his first world tour in 10 years. Now, as the record is re-released, complete with previously unheard demos, Sir Paul speaks to BBC 6 Music\'s Matt Everitt about collaborating with Costello, Kanye West and Michael Jackson - but why he\'ll never work with anyone better than John Lennon. Sir Paul also reveals he\'s working on a new album with Adele\'s producer, and what he thinks his musical legacy will be. My thing with collaboration, I know I can never have a better collaborator than John. That is just a fact. So I don\'t try and escape it. I just know there\'s no way I can find someone now who\'s going to write better stuff with me than I wrote with John. But having said that, I\'m interested in working with other people because they bring their own particular thing to it. If you\'re thinking of someone like Stevie (Wonder), he works by just making something up on his keyboards. You invite him to dinner, he shows up 10 hours later because he was fiddling around on his keyboard. He\'s such a musical monster and such a genius, that\'s what you learn from him. Michael Jackson, we just sat upstairs in this office and I tinkled on the piano and we just made up a song there. Now with Kanye, I had no idea what was going to happen because I knew it wasn\'t going to be two acoustic guitars opposite each other. So I thought, \'Well, here goes nothing\'. The one provision I said to everyone, I said, \'Look, if I feel this doesn\'t work out, then we just won\'t tell anyone. Kanye who? I didn\'t work with him!\' I just was myself and I told Kanye various stories that had inspired me musically. One of them was how the song Let It Be arrived, which was through a dream I\'d had in which I\'d seen my mother, who had died 10 years previously. But I was so inspired by that that I wrote the song. I told Kanye that, because he\'d lost his mother. So then he wrote a song called Only One when I was just noodling around on the electronic piano. So he got the melody, I put the chords in and the style and that\'s how it happened. I think so. I\'m just bringing up my family, and then a point will arrive where I just think, \'OK, I\'ve got some songs. I should get busy, I should record these. We should go out on tour. It\'s time\'. And that\'s what happened round about that time. It was suggested to me that I work with Elvis Costello as a partnership and it seemed like a good idea. I thought, \'Well, he\'s from Liverpool, he\'s good\' - which helps - and we have a lot of things in common and so I thought, \'Well that could work\'. There\'s a million ways to write, but the way I always used to write was with John and it would be across from each other, either in a hotel bedroom on the twin beds, with an acoustic guitar and we\'re just looking at each other. He\'d make up something, I\'d make up something and we\'d just spin off each other. The nice thing for me is seeing John there, him being right-handed, me being left-handed, it felt to me like I was looking in a mirror. Obviously, it was very successful. So that was a way I had learned to write and it was the way I liked to write and Elvis was very happy to work like that. So it was like a repeat of that process, and so he was John, basically, and I was Paul. I didn\'t work with Chuck. I met him. He came to one of our concerts when we were playing in St. Louis, his home town, and he came round backstage. It was great to meet him and just be able to tell him what a fan I was. When I think back to being in Liverpool pre-Beatles, when we were all just kids learning the guitar with the dreams of the future, we suddenly heard this little thing, Sweet Little Sixteen. We never heard anything like that, and then when Johnny B. Goode came along, all of his fantastic songs, Maybellene. All these songs about cars, teenagers, rock \'n roll music, was just so thrilling. I think you do and you put it out your mind. I don\'t get into it, really. I remember John once, saying to me, \'I wonder how I\'ll be remembered. Will they remember me well?\'. And I had to reassure him. I said, \'Look at me. You are going to be so remembered, you\'ve done so much great stuff\'. But it was funny - you wouldn\'t think John would even have a remote bit of insecurity about it. But I think people do. Luckily, it won\'t matter because I won\'t be here. I\'m making a new album which is great fun. I\'m working with a producer I first worked with two years ago on a piece of music I\'m doing for an animated film. Since then, he went on to work with Beck and got album of the year with Beck. Then he went on to work with Adele and has just got song of the year, record of the year, with Adele, and just got producer of the year. So my only worry is, people are going to go, \'Oh, there\'s Paul going with the flavour of the month\'. But he\'s a great guy called Greg Kurstin and he\'s great to work with. So yeah, I\'m at it. Beavering away, doing what I love to do. As Ringo says, \'It\'s what we do\'. ',entertainment
'Lord King: Scotland \'could be independent\' Scotland \"could be an independent country\" but would risk a hit to its public finances, the ex-governor of the Bank of England has said. Lord King told BBC Newsnight that while questions had been raised over which currency an independent Scotland would use, he did not see \"major problems\". But he said it could be a challenge to borrow on the international markets. On Brexit, he said his \"biggest worry\" was \"obsessed\" politicians ignoring the trade deficit and NHS funding. it is not the time for a Scottish independence referendum. But Scotland\'s First Minister to have an independence referendum on her timescale. Lord King, who headed the Bank of England between 2003 and 2013, said there are plenty of small countries the same size as Scotland, and it \"certainly\" could be independent.\"It has... the people, it has a capital city, a history and culture, it could be an independent country. The question is, does it want to be given the consequences of it?\" he said.\"And if the oil price remains low and if they lose the money which is transferred from the rest of the UK to Scotland, then they would have to make that up in their own budget, but that\'s a consequence of deciding to be financially independent, you end up paying for yourself. \"And it would be a challenge to borrow on the international market if Scotland decided to run a large budget deficit. I think that would be expensive, the interest rate would go up.\"Ahead of the 2014 referendum, ratings agency Fitch warned that plans for an independent Scotland to continue use of the pound without shared fiscal and banking union with the UK could risk \"high volatility and market turbulence\". Lord King said: \"I myself don\'t think there are any major problems in terms of currency, that was the thing project fear focussed on last time, but there is an issue about public finances.\"Pensions concerns He also said he had concerns about a range of issues facing the UK in future. \"My biggest worry about economic policy in the next few years is that all the politicians seem obsessed with Brexit.\"And actually, the biggest problems we face now are not Brexit, it\'s about how we can reduce the trade deficit, how we\'re going to save enough as a nation to pay for our pensions... how we\'re going to save enough to pay for care for the elderly... how we are going to finance the NHS.\" He added that if politicians only focused on Brexit over the next two or three years, \"then those big questions will not receive the attention which they deserve\". On the implications for Northern Ireland\'s border with the Republic of Ireland post-Brexit, Lord King said it was in \"everyone\'s interests to have an imaginative discussion about where we should go\". He said there may be a \"way of shifting the tax and tariff border, from the land frontier to the sea frontier while not disturbing the political arrangements\". And he added: \"There\'s no reason why the rate of corporation tax in Northern Ireland has to be the same as in the rest of the UK, once we have the freedom to do that.\"',politics
'Inside the TalkTalk \'Indian scam call centre\' TalkTalk customers are being targeted by an industrial-scale fraud network in India, according to whistleblowers who say they were among hundreds of staff hired to scam customers of the British telecoms giant. The scale of the criminal operation has been detailed by the three sources, who say they were employed by two front-companies set up by a gang of professional fraudsters. The sources describe working in \"call centres\" in two Indian cities. They say as many as 60 \"employees\" work in shifts in each office, phoning TalkTalk customers and duping them into giving access to their bank accounts. The whistleblowers say they were given a script in which they were told to claim they were calling from TalkTalk. They say they then convinced victims to install a computer virus. A separate team would use that virus to gain access to victims\' online banking, they add. While it has not been possible to independently verify their claims, the sources have given highly detailed accounts of the scammers\' tactics, which correlate very closely with previous reports of fraud targeting TalkTalk customers. The software they named also in its own website guidance on what to watch out for in a scam call. In addition, a victim of the fraud shown the call centre script has confirmed it matched the one read out to her when she was conned out of £5, 000. TalkTalk was hit by a cyber-attack in October 2015, but that hack appears to be unrelated to the Indian fraud. Instead, it is alleged the scam is linked to problems in a company hired by the British broadband provider. In 2011, TalkTalk outsourced some of its call-centre work to the Kolkata (Calcutta) office of Wipro, one of India\'s largest IT service companies. Last year, three Wipro employees were arrested on . A source in Kolkata, who did not want to be named, alleges the same data was obtained by a criminal gang, with USB sticks full of data trading hands at parties. The criminals then used the data to operate at least three call centres, according to the whistleblowers, where staff work in shifts earning about £120 per month to perpetrate an intricate but highly successful scam. They say they phone TalkTalk customers, using the stolen data to convince victims they are genuine employees of the company. They then convince the victims their computers are infected, and offer to fix the problems. Through this, the whistleblowers say, the victim is tricked into installing a virus that gives the scammer complete control over their machine. The victims are then offered a compensation payment, for which they must log in to online banking, they add. Thanks to the virus, the fraudsters are able to gain access to the victims\' bank accounts when they log in. They say they use various methods to spirit away the money: in some cases pretending to make erroneous overpayments, then convincing victims to repay the extra amount. In other cases, victims have said the scammers were able to set up a new payee without their knowledge and transfer the money out of the account directly. Why the whistleblowers appear credible: Although the BBC cannot be sure of the whistleblowers claims, the following suggested they were telling the truth: the three whistleblowers approached us seemingly independently of each other; the information they shared - including the scripts they were told to read out - correlated to a high degree during extensive online conversations, they revealed in-depth knowledge of the scammers\' techniques, much of which is not in the public domain and matches the experience of TalkTalk fraud victims one of the whistleblowers shared a copy of his driver\'s licence, confirming his identity the whistleblowers said they were ignorant of the full scale of the fraud, because the eventual bank account theft was handled by a separate, smaller team in a different office at one stage, two of the whistleblowers attempted to share the information of UK victims they had called, and asked us to warn the victims before they fell for the scam Dozens of customers are said to have been affected, and many have lost thousands of pounds as a result of the fraud. Leigh Day solicitors is representing about 20 people who have between them lost almost £100, 000. Questions remain about the speed with which TalkTalk responded to the data breach at Wipro, which is believed to have been in late 2014. It was only in October 2015, after the apparently unrelated cyber-attack, that TalkTalk began a \"forensic review\" leading to the arrests at Wipro.\"We are aware that there are criminals targeting a number of UK and international companies, and we take our responsibility to protect our customers very seriously,\" said a spokeswoman for TalkTalk.\"This is why we launched our Beat The Scammers campaign, helping all our customers to keep themselves from safe from scammers no matter who they claim to be, while our network also proactively blocks over 90 million scam and nuisance calls a month.\"Wipro did not respond to requests for comment. When contacted, the two companies named by the whistleblowers strongly denied any knowledge of criminal behaviour, and insisted their businesses were legitimate.',tech
'Pro12: Leinster 22-21 Cardiff Blues Leinster resisted a spirited Cardiff Blues revival to strengthen their position at the top of the Pro12 table. Tries from Dan Leavy and Luke McGrath - either side of a brilliant breakaway by the Blues\' Tomos Williams - put the hosts 14-7 ahead at half-time. The visitors fought back to lead 21-17 after counter-attacking scores from Williams and Sion Bennett. But Ross Molony plunged over from close to give Leinster a seventh successive league win. Leo Cullen\'s men are now six points clear at the Pro12 summit, with second-placed Ospreys away against Treviso later on Saturday. Defeat for the Blues, meanwhile, sees them stay in eighth place. Running rugby on show at the RDS Glorious sunshine and a pristine pitch made for perfect conditions at the RDS, encouraging both teams to play adventurous, running rugby. Leinster led after just four minutes as flanker Leavy collected a neat grubber kick from centre Noel Reid to touch down in the corner. Their lead did not last long as the visitors counter-attacked at pace, with captain Blaine Scully and Rey Lee-Lo offloading sharply before Williams cantered over. The Blues were threatening whenever their backs got their hands on the ball but their pack struggled against the ballast of Leinster\'s forwards, whose powerful carries paved the way for scrum-half McGrath to dive through a crowd of bodies and touch down. The visitors fought back in spectacular fashion, with Williams finishing after a fine run from hooker Kristian Dacey, before replacement back-rower Bennett showed a similarly impressive turn of pace to run in from 40 yards and put the Blues 21-17 ahead. It was the Leinster pack, however, who had the final say, with lock Molony emerging at the bottom of a pile of bodies to score the decisive try.

'Obesity crisis: Is this the food that is making us all fat? A teaspoon of oil, measured out with precision, is how Professor Tim Benton remembers his mother preparing items for frying. When he was growing up in the 1960s, vegetable oil was still a precious commodity and used sparingly. Fast-forward to today and oil is now so abundant and cheaply available that most of us use it liberally in our cooking - chucking it in anything from salad dressings to deep fat frying. It\'s not only in our home cooking, oil is also an ingredient in most of the items we buy from the supermarket. In fact, vegetable oil, specifically soy bean oil and palm oil, are two of the eight ingredients, alongside wheat, rice, maize, sugar, barley and potato, that are now estimated to provide a staggering 85\% of the world\'s calories. Increasingly, no matter what country we live in, we all eat similar diets which are heavy in calories and low in nutrients. It\'s a development that Prof Benton, a strategic research dean at the University of Leeds specialising in food security and sustainability, links directly to global trade. The production of vegetable oils and oil crops have both increased considerably over the past three decades. The rise has been driven by a combination of trade agreements, which have made it cheaper and easier to export and import oil, and various government policies. Subsidies in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, aimed at ramping up production for export, have helped to lower the cost of vegetable oil, for example. \"Competing in a global market requires a highly efficient production process driving scale and cheapness. Now we have a food system built on incredibly cheap calories,\" says Prof Benton. Of course, this food trade has in many cases helped reduce famine and, as Prof Benton points out, means the \"poorest of poor have access to cheap calories\". But he says this trade - which means more people are eating less healthy imports, rather than what is locally available - may also have helped to make us fatter. Over 50\% of the world\'s population is not of a \"healthy weight\", according to Prof Benton\'s . And worldwide obesity has more than doubled since 1980.\"The poorest anywhere still struggle to get sufficient calories and are underweight, but in our rich countries, poverty often does not stop people being able to eat (and drink) calories, but it does stop them having a nutrient-rich diet,\" the report says. Prof Corinna Hawkes, director of the Centre for Food Policy at City, University of London, says the greatest increase in sources of calories since the globalisation era began, has come from oil crops.\"There was a very sudden and marked increase in the availability of soybean and palm oil and that to me is directly related with policies that made it easier to trade,\" she says. Oilseeds are now among the most widely traded crops, and most processed foods contain either palm oil or soybean oil, which can help extend shelf life, she says.\"Because it became much easier and cheaper for the processed food industry to import it there was no disincentive for using it,\" she says. A small amount of fat is an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet. But fats are high in calories so eating a lot can increase the risk of becoming overweight or obese. Saturated and trans fats are also associated with heart disease. Prof Hawkes says that the low cost and availability of oil has meant some countries\' cooking habits have changed. In China, for example, food is deep fried in high quantities of oil and in Brazil, people use larger amounts of oil in traditional dishes. But alongside the increased trade of oil crops, she says, it\'s important to note that trade in fruit and vegetables has also increased, meaning many people\'s diets have actually improved. This discrepancy is what Prof Hawkes calls the \"quinoa question\". Increasing western demand for the so-called \"superfood\", which has been grown high in the Andes for thousands of years, has been blamed for its skyrocketing price and unavailability for people in the countries it first came from. The question goes to the heart of the controversy surrounding globalisation: that its rise has disproportionately benefited people who are already advantaged. So while people clued-up on nutrition and health may be getting healthier thanks to global trade, those without this knowledge have seen their diet deteriorate. However, the findings of , which looked at 26 countries between 1989 and 2005 when globalisation dramatically expanded, contradict this. The research concluded that \"social globalisation\" - changes in the way we work and live - was what was making us fat, rather than the wider availability of cheaper and more calorific foods driven by global trade. Basically, the fact that we are are now increasingly able to work, shop and socialise whilst barely moving a muscle is to blame, says study author Dr Joan Costa-Font.\"Our food intake is driven towards meeting the needs of a pre-global [socially speaking] world, where people would have to walk to places, and where there would not be as many energy-saving activities as today. Individuals would have closer personal social contacts, and would cook and spend more time on daily chores,\" he says. Dr Costa-Font says the research suggests that once people adapt their diet and lifestyle to these changes - basically move more and eat less - more normal weights will again prevail. He points to the US as an example. While obesity levels are alarmingly high at almost 35\%, he notes that this level has stayed pretty much the same over the past decade. \"That\'s good news. That\'s already something. \"It may be that the US is beginning to start to learn how to eat and adjust its lifestyle to a global one. The hypothesis is that this rise in obesity is only transitory.\"',business
'Sienna Miller on why her new role is not \'just a wife\' If there\'s one thing Sienna Miller has in common with the character she plays in exploration epic Lost City of Z, it\'s that she\'s not afraid to air her views, loud and clear. So much so that she altered a script when she thought Nina Fawcett was appearing as too much of a stereotypical \"wife\" - with the director framing the scrawled-on piece of paper. The film - based on a true story - is about explorer Percy Fawcett, played by Charlie Hunnam, and his quest to find a mysterious lost city in the heart of the Amazon. His first mission in 1906, accompanied by surveying partner Henry Costin (played by Robert Pattinson), sees them return with apparent evidence that this previously undiscovered community exists. Percy is drawn to return again and again, while his wife supports him and raises their family. \'Brave and stoic\' But one of Nina\'s first lines sees her complain about how restrictive a corset is - and her inability to be contained and constrained by society is a running theme. \"In the script, I was adamant that she wasn\'t just a wife - because she\'s a suffragette and she\'s a mother, and she was incredibly brave, self-sacrificing and stoic,\" says Miller. \"She was a huge part of the engine that ran this entire discovery; she found the piece of paper that proved there was a Z. She was just tireless in her support and her love. \"I can\'t imagine what it would have been like to be a woman then, and I wanted to represent the frustrations of how that would have felt, and not ask for pity, which I think is an easy trap to fall into when you\'re playing someone who\'s raising children and is left behind.\"She was very defiant and I loved that about her.\" The star of High Rise says Nina \"wasn\'t your typical early 20th Century housewife\", and that she and Percy - who were both Buddhists - were \"forward-thinking, progressive people\". She says: \"What film can do is give you a sense of what something would have felt like and the empathy that comes from that, and acknowledging how far we\'ve come and how much further we have to go. \"I hope it\'s thought-provoking, and I hope it\'s emotive. That\'s all you can hope for when you make a piece of work.\" \'Pioneering\' Miller says she doesn\'t think the film would have portrayed Nina as anything other than \"just a wife\" if it had been made even just 10 years ago. \"On paper, initially I did read it as sort of a wife part,\" she says. \"Both James [Gray, the director] and I were aware of that and worked really, really hard to ensure that wasn\'t the case. \"We were doing a script read-through and I was sitting next to James and there was a page that still felt very \'wifey\'.

'Proposal for mandatory webcasts of council meetings in Wales Webcasting of council meetings could become compulsory under Welsh Government proposals. A grant of £1. 25m was provided in 2013 to encourage authorities to in council chambers to allow them to broadcast meetings online. But not all councils stream meetings and the latest Welsh Government move has been backed by all parties. Conwy council said ministers will need to provide funding if the practice is to become mandatory. Mark Drakeford, cabinet secretary for local government, said in a written answer to a question about the one-off funding in 2013 from Conservative AM Janet Finch-Saunder, \"18 out of 22 local authorities are broadcasting their council meetings to some extent\". He has now proposed to make broadcasting of the meetings a \"statutory requirement\" as part of a , on which ministers are consulting. Ms Finch-Saunders said she was concerned not all councils provided streaming, adding: \"I welcome proposals to make broadcasting of council meetings a statutory requirement.\" Rhondda Cynon Taf ran an initial pilot of broadcasts, but chose to end the practice. A spokesman for the authority said the council had used Welsh Government grant funding, but did not extend its pilot as the costs \"were considered excessive at a time when the council faced significant financial challenges\".\"The council does tweet decisions made live from both cabinet and council meetings,\" he added. Conwy council has decided to investigate audio broadcasting rather than running video of meetings after its contract with an external provider came to an end. It has aired a limited number of meetings since last September. A spokeswoman said the council had considered whether it could fund webcasting \"given the high costs involved compared to the relatively-low viewing figures\" but said it felt the Welsh Government should provide funding if it is to become mandatory. Figures for live broadcasts can be \"minimal\" but increases for archived videos, with viewer numbers ranging between 142 and 1, 540, according to a paper seen at a council cabinet meeting. The Welsh Local Government Association warned that longer-term IT and administrative costs for web-casting \"will be considerable\" and will need to be balanced against \"prioritising front-line services\". A spokesman said the WLGA had been \"supportive\" of the roll-out of webcasting but added the costs of a mandatory requirement \"will need to be set out alongside any legislation\". A Welsh Government spokesman said: \"Progress has been made with the help of a single grant payment provided to local authorities but we now need to take this a step further.\"UKIP\'s Gareth Bennett said: \"Local residents in Wales will be rightly wondering why some councils appear to have closed the door on local democracy\". Sian Gwenllian of Plaid Cymru added the broadcasting of public meetings \"would enable more people to be engaged in local politics\".',politics
'SXSW 2017: Why is the Vatican at a tech conference? As Bishop Paul Tighe sat down for our interview, he joked that not only is he probably the only priest at South by Southwest, but also the only person with grey hair. His presence here marks the first time the Vatican has attended the South by Southwest Interactive conference, and their panel - titled Compassionate Disruption - is one of this year\'s most talked about events.\"In a world where increasingly [we\'re] not invited to part of conversations, I think if people are interested in having us, we\'re delighted to be here.\"I want to learn and get a feeling for what are the things that are driving a generation of people who are in many ways shaping the world as we know it. He glanced around the room. \"Really deep down, I see a lot of people looking for some sort of connectivity.\"That\'s certainly true - though I get the sense for delegates here that means good wi-fi, rather than a strong sense of faith. So Bishop Tighe\'s mission is to get this industry to find real value in both. Rough welcome As the Vatican\'s Adjunct Secretary of the Pontifical Council for Culture, one of Bishop Tighe\'s many responsibilities is to run the social media accounts for the Pope, as well as considering ways in which the Catholic Church can stretch its influence into our digital lives. Five years ago, Pope Benedict decided to set up a Twitter account - @Pontifex - which is continued today by Pope Francis. It was a decision the Church at the time felt was hugely symbolic. \"There\'s an environment that is kinda rough,\" Bishop Tighe said.\"There\'s a lot of trolling, a lot of negativity. \"But if the people who want to use it for good withdraw from it, then the trolls have won. There is a potential here to build connections, to learn from people who might surprise us.\"The Bishop winced a little as I asked him whether Pope Benedict received a warm welcome on Twitter.\"There was a welcome from many, but there was a huge amount of negativity,\" he said. \"There were people saying \'let\'s launch a Twitter bomb, lets force them out of this environment\'. But we stuck with it and said \'no, this is too important a forum\'.\"He said the current Pope handed down a clear strategy for communicating - not preaching - on Twitter.\"When Pope Francis gave us our instructions he said \'the one thing I want you to be above all is try to encourage people. It\'s a tough world, it\'s a hard world, let\'s be at least encouraging\'.\"\'Disturbed\' Ten years ago, SXSW Interactive enjoyed what\'s still its most significant moment - the \"launch\" of Twitter. The service had been around for a little while before appearing at the festival, but it was here that its popularity skyrocketed. The Vatican was hesitant to get involved, unsure of how to interact with the new medium - and whether it should be there at all. \"Maybe for the Church this world has disturbed us, has disrupted a lot of our ways of forming community. It\'s making us think again about how to do our business.\" Part of that business, he suggested, was in making people consider what kind of online world they want to exist in, and how to achieve it in the face of increased hostility and division. In explaining it he coined a phrase that may just resonate with his audience here.\"A few years ago, everyone was talking about User-Generated Content. But I think we also need to recover a sense of User-Generated Culture. That\'s the choice of individuals. \"If you\'re spending your day with a lot of negative stuff in the environment, it\'s easy to imbibe that, to take that on board. But the challenge for all of us is to try and say \'yes, I\'m going to be there, but I\'m not going to be conditioned by the less positive sides of that\'.\"God vs Big Data While it\'s the Vatican\'s first time at SXSW, it\'s certainly not the first technology conference it has attended. Bishop Tighe also attended Web Summit in Lisbon last year, and there, as it is here, the hot topic was the growing power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I put it to him that we are living at a time when the majority of people are far more likely to search Google for answers than they are to pray. When the Amazon Alexa in the corner of my kitchen can give me immediate answers based on data, why turn anywhere else?\"All the data in the world will still leave room for choices that I have to make,\" he said. \"If we say big data will tell us what\'s right or wrong, then I am no longer an agent, and my choices have been determined for me. That doesn\'t correspond to my experience of being a human.\"More profound, he said, will be the emergence of artificial intelligence and robotics in the working environment. Money aside, he argued we should be concerned about what a lack of work could do to our sense of self worth.\"Let\'s not romanticise it - some of the work that might be displaced is fairly tough, dangerous work and fairly menial. Maybe it\'s no great loss. \"[But] we need to reflect on how human beings who work are not just economic units producing products, they\'re people with stories and families.\"I finished by asking him whether, given the chance, he\'d offer some advice to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg over how he could change the world\'s largest online community for the better. To my surprise, he didn\'t want to change anything - but he made a plea for technology innovators and entrepreneurs to consider how to involve the Church and others in building their products.\"I think it\'s really a time for a good, robust conversation between programmers and people who are coming form different ethical and philosophical positions.\"We must ensure that our human values and achievements, in terms of respecting dignity and the worth of people, will somehow be programmed into the machines we work with.\"',tech

'Delay Brexit if no trade deal reached, say business leaders Brexit should be delayed if no trade deal can be struck with the EU by the end of the two-year negotiating process, business leaders have said. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also wants businesses to continue to be allowed to recruit skilled and low-skilled EU workers after the UK leaves. The business organisation is holding its annual conference on Tuesday. Theresa May has said she will trigger Article 50 by the end of March which would start the process of leaving. The BCC said completing a trade deal within the two years allowed by Article 50 would be the \"ideal outcome\". But it continued: \"Should this prove impossible, we should seek an extension to the negotiating period to enable completion of both agreements concurrently.\"However, such an extension would only be possible if all EU member states agree. Business Secretary Greg Clark and shadow chancellor John McDonnell will be among those addressing the conference in London. BCC director general Adam Marshall said: \"Business communities across the UK want practical considerations, not ideology or politics, at the heart of the government\'s approach to Brexit negotiations.\"What\'s debated in Westminster often isn\'t what matters for most businesses.\"Most firms care little about the exact process for triggering Article 50, but they care a lot about an unexpected VAT hit to their cash flow, sudden changes to regulation, the inability to recruit the right people for the job, or if their products are stopped by customs authorities at the border.\" Incompatible aims? It\'s on immigration that the BCC is most likely to be disappointed. It\'s calling for its members to be able to recruit across the EU after Brexit with minimal bureaucracy, costs or barriers. But it\'s difficult to see how that is compatible with the government\'s stated aim of bringing immigration down to tens of thousands a year. Or how it could square with the prime minister\'s recent declaration that Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe. The BCC\'s comments come after former Prime Minister Sir John Major warned that the chances of no agreement being reached within the time limit were \"very high\". In a speech, he warned that an \"unreal and over-optimistic\" vision of Brexit was being put forward. Downing Street said the government was determined to make a success of Brexit.',business
'Historical dramas \'limit UK black actors\' Actress Thandie Newton has said she \"can\'t work\" in the UK because there are no roles for black and minority ethnic actors in historical dramas. London-born Newton said the number of costume dramas had led to \"slim pickings for people of colour\". Her criticism comes after British Film Institute research found that 59\% of UK films since 2006 had no black actors in any role. Newton\'s next UK TV role will see her appear in BBC One\'s . Speaking to the Sunday Times Magazine, the mother-of-three said: \"I love being here, but I can\'t work, because I can\'t do Downton Abbey, can\'t be in Victoria, can\'t be in Call The Midwife - well, I could, but I don\'t want to play someone who\'s being racially abused.\" \"I\'m not interested in that, don\'t want to do it... there just seems to be a desire for stuff about the Royal Family, stuff from the past, which is understandable, but it just makes it slim pickings for people of colour.\"Newton is one of many British actors who have complained about the lack of ethnic diversity in UK TV and film. Former Spooks star David Oyelowo said there had been an exodus of black British actors to the USA, due to the lack of opportunities available in British drama. In 2015, the star of A United Kingdom said: \"We make period dramas in Britain, but there are almost never black people in them, even though we\'ve been on these shores for hundreds of years.\"It\'s frustrating, because it doesn\'t have to be that way\". On the US stage, black actors portrayed white historical figures like George Washington in Broadway musical Hamilton, which retells the story of American founding father Alexander Hamilton. The migration of black British actors to the US has been criticised by Hollywood star Samuel L Jackson. He criticised the industry for hiring UK stars to play American roles, and said: \"We\'ve got a lot of brothers here that need to work too.\"His comments came after Skins actor Daniel Kaluuya starred in US racial thriller Get Out. He said: \"I love all my black brothers and sisters worldwide, and that\'s my position.\"All I know is this my first-ever lead role in a film and I\'ve lost out on a lot of roles because I\'m black.\"He added: \"It\'s my one shot.

'Reality Check: Is deporting of \'bad dudes\' at record rate? Since Donald Trump became president, the US has been, for the first time, deporting serious criminals, including gang members and drug lords, and the deportations are taking place at an unprecedented rate. The US has been deporting gang members and other serious criminals for many years. There is not enough data yet to say whether the rate of deportations has increased under President Trump. On 25 January, President Trump signed an executive order that established a range of measures aimed at reducing illegal immigration. The new measures have and the category of people listed as a priority for removal includes those convicted of criminal offences, those who have engaged in \"fraud or wilful misrepresentation\", and anyone an immigration officer may consider poses a threat to \"public safety or national security\". Donald Trump claimed that since he became president, the US was, for the first time, deporting the really serious criminals such as gang members and drug lords, and that deportations were taking place at an unprecedented rate. He made similar claims on 28 February during an interview with Fox News about taking a tougher line on deportations. The , which is the investigative arm of the Department for Homeland Security and responsible for deporting undocumented immigrants, show that from 2009 to 2016, the US removed a total of 2. 75 million people. The number of Ice removals peaked in 2012, but fell significantly by 2016. The Ice report suggests the fall was because the focus in recent years switched to removing smaller numbers of more serious criminals from the country. The Obama administration introduced three levels of priority for deportations in 2014. The highest priority was removals of individuals identified as: \"national security threats, convicted felons or aggravated felons, criminal gang participants, and illegal entrants apprehended at the border.\"Between 1 October 2015 and 30 September 2016, 58\% of those who were deported were convicted criminals. By comparison, the proportion of criminals removed between the same dates in 2008 and 2009 were 31\% and 35\% respectively. There were 2, 057 individuals removed by the agency in 2016 who were classified as \"suspected or confirmed gang members\". The agency does not list \"drug lords\" or individuals with drug-related criminal records as a category of removed persons. So, what about the rate at which the agency is removing people from the US? The latest available Ice figures run until January 2017. In that month, 17, 833 individuals were removed, but the agency has not published the breakdown that would show the number of gang members deported. This was down from the previous month when 20, 574 individuals were removed. The figure for January 2016 was very similar to the one from January 2017. On 6 February 2017, Ice that specifically targeted \"convicted criminal aliens and other immigration enforcement priorities\". In total, more than 680 arrests were made in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, New York and San Antonio. On that date, Donald Trump had been president for 16 days. We do not have enough data to compare the rate of removal under his presidency with the previous rate. So, whether the rate of deportations of serious criminals increases or decreases under the Trump administration remains to be seen. ',politics

'Eddie Stobart: Lorry firm targets £550m stock market listing Lorry firm Eddie Stobart is listing its shares in London next month, a move that should value the firm at £550m. The company\'s green and red trucks - each of them bearing a different woman\'s name - are a mainstay of British motorways. It is returning to the stock market three years after its parent company sold half the business to pay debts. Since then, it has invested heavily and is raising fresh funds to help it grow further. Founded in 1970, its distinctive lorries have attracted thousands of dedicated truck-spotting fans. Celebrity spotters include musicians Jools Holland, Shane Lynch, Chico and Ronan Keating, according to the Stobart Club. It employs more than 5, 500 members of staff and operates 2, 200 vehicles, as well as logistics centres and freight rail services. \'Transformed\' Eddie Stobart was started by entrepreneur Edward Stobart with only eight trucks and 12 employees before he later sold it to his family. Mr Stobart died in 2011. One of his ideas was to give each lorry a woman\'s name, starting with Twiggy, after the model, and later there was a Tammy and a Dolly, after singers Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton. The first time that the firm listed on the stock market in 2007, it was as part of the wider Stobart Group, whose other businesses include Southend Airport and a regional airline in Ireland. But the Stobart Group sold 51\% of the truck business for £281m in 2014 as it looked to pay off debts and focus on other areas. Eddie Stobart\'s chief executive Alex Laffey said that in the last three years, the truck company had been \"transformed\". \"An IPO [initial public offering] is an exciting next step for the business that will give us a strong platform for further growth,\" he said. The freight firm had revenues of £549m and adjusted profits of £41m last year. It is expected to start selling shares on London\'s Alternative Investment Market in April 2017.',business
'Form 696: Concern over \'racist\' police form to be raised The government is to respond to fears a police risk assessment form has been used in a \"racist\" way to target grime artists, the BBC understands. Promoters and licensees in many areas are asked to complete a \"Form 696\" before hosting some music events featuring \"DJs and MCs\". Culture Minister Matt Hancock is set to raise concerns with Mayor Sadiq Khan about the use of the form in London. The Met Police denies the voluntary form targets certain genres of music. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has found some forces, such as Leicestershire Police, still ask for the ethnic make-up of the audience attending and the music genre being played at an event, on the form. Those two questions were removed from the original Met Police form in 2009, following complaints it was racist and it was profiling certain groups. A Freedom of Information request also found a version of the form has now been adopted by 16 other forces in England. Gig cancellations The Met\'s Promotion Event Risk Assessment Form 696 - or simply Form 696 - asks for the names, stage names, addresses and phone numbers of all promoters and artists at an event. Organisers of \"live music events\" do not have to fill it out, as it is intended to cover garage, R&amp; B and grime performances, where a pre-recorded backing track is used. Police say the form aims to ensure event owners provide a safe working and leisure environment for all those attending events and promotions - including musicians, performers, staff and customers. They say the process helps to reduce crime and disorder, provides up-to-date information about past and future promotions and encourages venues, police, local authorities and promoters to share information better. However, grime artists have told the BBC\'s Victoria Derbyshire programme that information passed on via the form has prompted the cancellation of their gigs at the last minute.\'A race thing\' Rapper Giggs had his tour cancelled in 2010 following police advice. Last year, he called for with grime acts to stop shows being cancelled. Artist P Money said he had been removed from gig line-ups on account of information passed on via the form. He described the form as a \"race thing\".\"It\'s been happening for so many years that now we kind of know, it\'s just our scene. They [police] target grime a lot, they just blame a lot of things on grime.\" He said: \"We know they\'re just trying to shut down grime, because if it was anything else they wouldn\'t have this issue. \"If, for example, Ed Sheeran had a show and a fight broke out, he\'s not going to do a 696 on his next arena tour.\"A fight still might have broken out though, but they don\'t look at it like that. They just think, \'Oh it\'s different for them.\' \"Why is it different? There\'s fights everywhere, there\'s situations everywhere at all types of shows, all types of things, whether its punk, rock, hip hop, pop, whatever.\" Alan Miller, chairman of the Night Time Industries Association, said the form was \"flawed\", adding: \"You do not get more crime with young black men than you do with young white men or anyone else.\"\'Mitigate risks\' Leicestershire Police said its form was under review and its contents may change, but gave no date for when this may happen. Bedfordshire Police also ask for on its form, saying that \"failure to complete the risk assessment correctly may jeopardise future events by the promoter and the venue\". In a statement, the Met said information on its form allowed officers to carry out research so \"additional measures can be put in place to mitigate any risks\". \"The form does not target any particular group nor does it ask for the genre of music, event type, age range or demographic of the customers who attend.\" In 2009, the force following public criticism.

The Mayor of London\'s office said: \"Our priority is to keep Londoners safe and support a vibrant night-time economy, and this means ensuring that all performances have the most appropriate security and safety plans in place.\"We have supported a number of events that bring together the Met, music venues, and promoters to try to improve the understanding of when and how Risk Assessment Form 696 should be used.\"',entertainment
'Brexit: Full control of borders among six UKIP tests The UK must have \"full control\" of its borders and territorial waters after Brexit, UKIP has said as it set out six tests for Theresa May as she prepares to begin the process of leaving the EU. UKIP wants full \"maritime sovereignty\" and Parliamentary supremacy over laws, no \"divorce bill\" nor payments to the EU budget after the UK\'s withdrawal. Party leader Paul Nuttall said UKIP would act as the \"guard dog\" of Brexit. The prime minister will invoke Article 50 on Wednesday. This will trigger a two-year process in which the UK and the remaining 27 EU nations will seek to agree the terms of the UK\'s exit as well as the outline of the UK\'s future relationship with the union. In a speech on Monday, Mr Nuttall said that the UK\'s exit - set in motion by last year\'s Leave referendum vote - must be \"done and dusted\" by the end of 2019. As it stands, the UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, unless both sides agree to extend talks. But Brexit supporters have also spoken for the need for a completely \"clean break\", arguing there can be no transitional arrangements nor payments to maintain access to the single market afterwards. Mr Nuttall set out six key objectives that he says any acceptable final agreement must be judged against: Full control of immigration, asylum and border controls Restoration of full maritime sovereignty A seat on the WTO with the UK free to do trade deals with whoever it likes No final settlement payment and no ongoing payments to the EU budget No impediments nor restrictions on the law-making supremacy of UK Parliament Brexit must be over by the end of 2019 \"While we will be willing Mrs May to succeed in agreeing to a full Brexit on our terms, we want her to keep faith with the will of the British people as expressed in the referendum result,\" he said.\"We will also be letting her know that the political price she will pay for backsliding or watering down the ambitions will be very high indeed. I have described this role as akin to being the guard dog of Brexit.\"UKIP has suggested fishing will be one of the early tests of how hard a bargain Mrs May is prepared to drive. It has warned the government against adopting any aspects of Common Fisheries Policy into UK law as part of its proposed Great Repeal Bill. This legislation will transfer existing EU laws applying to the UK onto the statute book before Parliament decides later which to keep and which to jettison. Vessels from other EU nations, UKIP argues, should not have any form of \"backdoor\" access to UK territorial waters, with domestic fleets having sole entry to a 200 mile \"exclusive economic zone\". EU officials have suggested the UK could have to pay up to £50bn to retain privileged access to the single market and to settle existing budget liabilities although a recent House of Lords committee report argued the UK would not be lawfully obliged to pay a penny. UKIP will have little sway in Parliament when a vote is held on the final settlement as its only MP - Douglas Carswell - quit over the weekend and said he plans to serve as an independent. The party only has a handful of peers in the House of Lords. However, UKIP has 20 MEPs in the European Parliament, which also has to give its consent to the terms of the UK\'s exit. Labour set out its own six tests on Monday, including no dilution of the benefits the UK currently gets through the single market and customs union. It also warned against rushing the negotiations.',politics
'MWC 2017: 5G - who wants it, who’ll pay? The hot topic at Mobile World Congress this year is not a new phone - , they all look the same. Nor is it a new technology like virtual reality - compared with last year, there seem to be fewer VR headsets around. No, the biggest thing in Barcelona is something invisible that doesn\'t yet exist, 5G. The hype about the potential of the next generation of mobile networks has reached new heights, with every major company exhibiting here eager to explain how it will be at the cutting edge of the coming 5G revolution. Governments too have decided it is now technologically correct (can I coin the term TC?) to rave about the importance to the economy of being 5G-ready. On the UK stand, the Trade Minister, Greg Hands, told me funds would continue to pour into 5G research post-Brexit. Over at the Intel stand, they had gone as far as to build a prototype 5G network to give us a feel of what this new connected paradise would be like. There was an autonomous car, a connected home, and a smart lamppost all talking to the network at breakneck speed. Visitors were invited to don a Microsoft HoloLens headset for an augmented reality display of seas of data flowing round the stand and up into the sky. It was easy to forget there was still no agreement on exactly what constitutes 5G, and most countries still had to work out what spectrum would be needed and how they would allocate it. More important, perhaps, there is no sense that consumers know anything about it or have any sense that they want it - in fact my sense is that most would prefer to see a bit more of the 4G vision realised before the next revolution comes along. More from MWC 2017: But Intel\'s Aicha Evans did a good job explaining why we should be excited about the promise of 5G. She told me: \"Think about what was life like without smartphones - start there,\" and then explained that just as that revolution had connected people, so this next one would allow everything else to get connected, enabling all sorts of advances in the way we live. Now, Intel is a hardware company that stands to benefit as the telecoms industry has to retool for 5G, but I came away from the exhibit almost convinced. But then I ran into two 5G sceptics. The first was a senior executive at one of the world\'s biggest mobile operators, who took a very cynical view of his industry\'s current state. \"Who\'s going to pay for it?\" he asked me, adding operators were already seeing their margins squeezed, as they battled with nimble newcomers such as WhatsApp, and had little appetite to pour money into 5G without seeing much of a return. The second was a chief technologist at a major networking equipment company - one that could stand to benefit from the 5G rollout. But he described the hype around the technology as \"irrational exuberance\" - the same term used by an economist warning in the late 1990s about the dot-com bubble. He believed that current advances in 4G - what\'s known as Gigabit LTE, which enables much faster data rates over existing networks - offered a more practical and affordable solution. Nevertheless, he said, there was such a head of steam behind 5G that it was likely to happen, just as the dot-com bubble had led to vast and unaffordable investments in fibre networks. But the result was likely to be another radical reshaping of the telecoms industry, So the 5G revolution is coming.

'The plus-size personal trainer aiming for \'strong not skinny\' Meet Kate Buckland, the plus-size personal trainer. She doesn\'t conform to the norm, working in an industry obsessed with body perfection, saying \"that doesn\'t fit with me\". The mum of two used to weigh 22 stone and was a size 26 at her biggest. Now she\'s a size 16. Kate shed the weight because she felt uncomfortable in her own skin. \"My back fat rubbed together, my tummy fat rubbed together. It felt horrible,\" she says. She makes no apologies for being a size 16, and why would she? \"I\'m not doing this to be skinny,\" she adds,\"Body perfection doesn\'t fit with me and it\'s not something I aspire to. I am plus-size and I\'m cool with that.\"Her can-do attitude as an Australian living in Southampton is a far cry from her previous life working in a stressful job in PR. A panic attack while driving on the motorway was the moment she knew she needed to make some serious changes. A job that meant few hours at home - and delivering bad news on a daily basis - no longer worked for her and her family. A friend suggested she became a personal trainer. She laughed at the idea but somehow the idea stuck, and soon it was no longer a joke.\'It\'s the best thing I\'ve ever done\' \"I turned to fitness as a form of stress relief. It\'s the best thing I\'ve ever done,\" she recalls. What\'s her secret to losing weight? Kate \"found her why\" - her kids. She wants to see them grow up, plus she hated feeling horrible in her own body. She became morbidly obese after giving birth to her two children and suffers with phenylketonuria, a condition that means her body struggles to break down protein. Now at size 16, she\'s out running, cycling and lifting weights, while leading classes and inspiring others to get fit. As we know, putting your trainers on and getting out can be hardest part of exercise, and Kate is no different. \"Sometimes I hate it but I know I\'ll feel better once I\'ve done it. I push myself to do things I don\'t think I can do.\"That\'s why she\'s signed up for the as a challenge to herself. \'I\'ve been called fatty\' But exercising, training or just going out and moving can be made even harder, when some, thankfully a minority, harass her.\"I\'ve been body-shamed. I\'ve been called \'fatty\' while running down the road. You just have to get on with it. It\'s not easy and people can be nasty but that is their problem, not mine. She adds: \"Sometimes it does make me want to turn around and walk away because it makes you feel small. I\'m not going to let them ruin my day. You just have to go out there and do \'you\' - just like they should be.\"Slam ball your way out of a stressful day It\'s an early-morning session in a park near where she lives - it\'s still chilly in the spring sunshine. Two mums, Caroline and Kerry, are put through their paces. They soon warm up and the layers of clothing are peeled off as they start at a gentle warm-up and get their hearts pumping. The pair know each other from picking up their kids in the playground after school. Now they are throwing their bodies to the floor and picking themselves up - burpees - a form of exercise most people loathe and something of an analogy for Kate\'s journey from fat to fit. It continues - slam balls. A 5kg soft ball raised above their heads and slammed to the floor. Good for stress after the daily chaos of the school run, they joke, and then lunges for strong glutes. The birds are tweeting and dog-walkers glance curiously as they pass by. \"This is our gym,\" the mums say. Kerry Booker, one of the mums who wants to be fitter to race after her twins, says: \"I much prefer being outside and having a laugh and joke. You haven\'t got to worry about the big muscly men making you feel intimidated. You\'re not in your best shape and you certainly don\'t have to look a certain way.\"\'Take small steps and small changes\' Trainer Kate documents her fitness journey on , from leg-burning wall sits on an evening boot camp session to lifting weights.\"I\'m helping people to be a version of themselves that they want to be but sometimes feel is unobtainable. To me it\'s really important and fulfilling.\" You don\'t have to run, jump or cycle to lose weight. Kate\'s journey started when even walking to the end of the drive was a struggle, but she started walking more and then moved on to a \"I\'ve never been skinny,\" she says. \"I\'ve never really been sporty. I don\'t do what I do to be a size 10. I want to be strong, capable and feel good in my own skin. That\'s what it\'s about for me. I couldn\'t care less about the number on my clothes or what anybody else thinks.\"For anyone wanting to make a change to their lives, Kate says: \"take small steps and small changes - go out there and be the best version of you\".',sport
'Tesco to replace 1, 700 managers with lower-paid staff Tesco plans to replace 1, 700 deputy managers in its chain of Express convenience stores. Their work will be taken by an extra 3, 300 lower paid \"shift leaders\", increasing staff numbers by 1, 600. The retailer said the deputy managers would be offered the new roles, redundancy payments or be redeployed. It comes on top of 1, 000 job cuts announced by Tesco in January as part of a plan to cut the number of its distribution centres. Tracey Clements, managing director of convenience stores at Tesco, said: \"To help improve our service to customers in our Express stores we are aiming to have more of our colleagues on the shop floor, more often. \"We appreciate that these changes will impact our deputy manager colleagues, and will do everything we can to support them throughout this period.\"Shifting trends In recent years, the UK\'s big four supermarket groups have faced stiff competition from smaller rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. This, combined with decreasing demand for weekly shops at large out-of-town stores, has forced them to revise their plans for expansion. Some poorly performing stores have been closed, while plans for new outlets have been abandoned. Earlier this month, Waitrose said it would shut six supermarkets and also remove a layer of management, cutting 700 jobs in the process, along with the removal of 180 department manager posts in its 350 stores. from Tesco showed that in the six weeks to 7 January, which covers the key Christmas period, like-for-like sales rose 0. 7\% in the UK.

'Colin Dexter, creator of Inspector Morse, dies aged 86 Colin Dexter, who wrote the Inspector Morse books, has died at the age of 86. His publisher said in a statement on Tuesday: \"With immense sadness, MacMillan announces the death of Colin Dexter who died peacefully at his home in Oxford this morning.\"His series of 13 Morse novels, written between 1975 and 1999, were adapted for the long-running ITV series, which starred John Thaw. Dexter\'s characters also featured in spin-off shows Lewis and Endeavour.\'Sharpest mind, biggest heart\' He wrote his first Morse novel, Last Bus to Woodstock, in 1975 while on holiday in Wales. The fictional detective was then killed off in the final book, The Remorseful Day. Inspector Morse and Lewis star Kevin Whately described him as \"impish and bubbly and always fascinated with everybody and everything\". He told BBC Oxford: \"I think I\'m incredibly lucky to have had 30 years of his friendship. He would always turn up - he loved being on set with us, and we loved having him there. He was a very warm, benign presence always.\"Whately joked: \"We used to give him a little role, give him the odd line to say, but he was so awful at speaking and acting that we only let him walk through the shot.\" Sheila Hancock, Thaw\'s widow, told : \"He did say to me a couple of times that he really did feel that John was the character and the character was John. It sort of evolved between them. In fact, I think one of the reasons he killed Morse off is he didn\'t want to imagine anyone else playing the part.\"She described Dexter as a \"remarkably well-read and clever man\", as well as a \"bubbly guy\" who \"just seemed to enjoy life so much\" and \"loved to laugh\". Maria Rejt, Dexter\'s most recent editor at MacMillan, said the author had \"inspired all those who worked with him\", adding: \"His loyalty, modesty and self-deprecating humour gave joy to many. His was the sharpest mind and the biggest heart, and his wonderful novels and stories will remain a testament to both.\" Kevin Lygo, director of television at ITV, said Inspector Morse was \"one of the nation\'s best-loved shows\", with Thaw\'s \"irascible detective with a love for crosswords, real ale and classical music\" becoming one of the most popular characters of all time. \"Through 33 feature length stories, the casebook of Morse and Lewis changed the landscape of detective drama,\" he said. Dexter worked closely behind the scenes of the show and later became a consultant on Lewis, the sequel starring Whately which ran for nine years. He was also \"one of the key creative forces\" behind prequel Endeavour - the inspector\'s first name - which saw Shaun Evans appear as the young Morse. MacMillan\'s publisher Jeremy Trevathan added that Dexter\'s death represented a \"tectonic shift in the international crime writing scene\". He said: \"Colin represented the absolute epitome of British crime writing, and in the 1990s John Thaw\'s Inspector Morse took over Wednesday night television. He was one of those television characters who the nation took to their hearts. This is a very sad day for us all.\" Fellow crime writers paid tribute on Twitter. Lynda La Plante : \"Colin Dexter, a masterful writer and storyteller who entertained millions of readers.\" \"Sad news - a gentle man with a steel mind; and the creator of such an iconic character...\" \"Deeply sorry to hear of the death of my good friend Colin Dexter. He brought pleasure to millions and joy to his friends.\"Maxim Jakubowski, vice-chairman of the Crime Writers\' Association told the BBC: \"He will be remembered not just as a superlative crime writer and the creator of such a classic character as Inspector Morse, but also as the most convivial of friends, impish, friendly to all, seldom seen in public without a smile, a man who accepted celebrity late in his life with wonderful dignity and humour.\"\'A large Glenfiddich\' Norman Colin Dexter was born in 1930 in Stamford, Lincolnshire, and studied classics at Cambridge University. He worked as a Latin and Greek teacher from 1954 to 1966 before moving to Oxford - where he set the Morse stories - to become a full-time writer. Carlton Productions made 33 Morse TV films with Thaw in the lead role. Dexter himself made many cameo appearances. Dexter had type 2 diabetes, a condition that he also gave Morse in the last few books of the series. When Dexter received an OBE for services to literature in 2000, he said he would have liked to have thought his fictional detective would have bought him a celebratory whisky. \"I think Morse, if he had really existed and was still alive, would probably say to me, \'Well, you didn\'t do me too bad a service in your writing\'.\"He might say, \'I wish you\'d made me a slightly less miserable blighter and slightly more generous, and you could have painted me in a little bit of a better light\'.\"If he had bought me a drink, a large Glenfiddich or something, that would have been very nice, but knowing him I doubt he would have done - Lewis always bought all the drinks.\" ',entertainment
'Paul Nuttall: UKIP \'mess\' will take time to sort out UKIP leader Paul Nuttall says he needs time to sort out the \"mess\" his party is in. Mr Nuttall urged UKIP to \"stick together\" after senior figures clashed following his Stoke by-election defeat. He said he took responsibility for inaccurate claims he lost close friends at Hillsborough but blamed reports he had not actually been at the match on an \"orchestrated smear campaign\". UKIP\'s latest row involves ex-leader Nigel Farage and MP Douglas Carswell. Claims Mr Carswell blocked an attempt to get Mr Farage a knighthood have been referred to UKIP\'s National Executive Committee. Mr Carswell has denied trying to stop the honour. Mr Farage has accused him of \"working for the Conservatives\" and called for him to be expelled from the party. And donor Arron Banks, a close ally of Mr Farage, has pledged to stand against Mr Carswell in his Clacton constituency. The infighting was put to Mr Nuttall when he appeared on the BBC\'s Andrew Marr Show. The leader said he would have \"no problem\" with Mr Carswell remaining in the party if he had in fact lobbied in favour of Mr Farage being knighted.\"We have had it in writing now from Douglas Carswell that he lobbied for Nigel Farage to get a knighthood and he spoke to the people involved,\" he said.\"He has put it in writing, let\'s see what happens. It\'ll go to the national executive from here.\"He added: \"If it\'s proven that Douglas lobbied for Nigel to get a knighthood... then I don\'t see a problem.\"Mr Carswell told ITV\'s Peston on Sunday he would \"absolutely\" fight the next general election as a UKIP candidate. In his BBC interview Mr Nuttall also said Mr Banks - who wants to be appointed chairman because he says the party is being run like a \"jumble sale\" - was not \"UKIP\'s major donor\".\"A lot of what Arron Banks says I tend to agree with,\" he said.\"UKIP needs to be professionalised.\"He predicted a \"big improvement in donations\".\"Give me time to sort out this mess,\" he added. Mr Nuttall said he had been \"hounded\" and subjected to \"unfair\" treatment by the press since he failed to get elected in the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election, which was held by Labour last month. During the campaign, he apologised over claims on his website that he had lost close personal friends in the Hillsborough disaster. He said a press officer had made the mistake but that he took responsibility, adding that he would \"stand in a witness stand in a court of law\" and confirm he had been at the match when he was 12 years old. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Nuttall said: \"I witnessed things that no child, I suppose, of 12-and-a-half should have to witness.\"But I will say this - I didn\'t witness the worst of it because thank God my father was an experienced match-goer and he realised pretty quickly that something was badly wrong and I think we were probably one of the first to leave the stadium.\"',politics
'\'Sex assault\' streamed on Facebook Live The alleged sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl by five or six males was streamed on Facebook Live, according to Chicago Police. Around 40 people were said to have been watching the stream at one point but nobody reported the incident to police. A police spokesman said authorities first learned of what happened after the girl\'s mother approached the head of police as he was leaving a station. Detectives have questioned several people but no arrests have been made. The video has since been removed. \'Hideous crimes\' The girl, who had been missing for a day, has now been found by detectives and reunited with her family. Her mother, whom the BBC is not naming, said her daughter appeared to be scared in the footage, adding \"it\'s so disgusting\". \"It\'s just terrible. I know they\'ll get their day coming,\" she said on Tuesday morning, before her daughter was found. Chicago police chief, Supt Eddie Johnson, was said to be \"visibly upset\" after the girl\'s mother showed him screenshots of the video. A relative of the girl, Reginald King, says he was the last to see her before the alleged attack, after the two attended church together on Sunday.\"Nobody deserves that. No human being deserves for that to happen to them,\" he told local media, adding that he suspects local \"thugs\" committed the attack. After the girl was found, she was taken to hospital with injuries to her face, he told the Chicago Tribune. A spokesman for Chicago police tweeted on Tuesday afternoon that police are \"making good progress\" in identifying the assailants.\"Interviews ongoing but no formal suspects named yet,\", Anthony Guglielmi added.\"Crimes like this are hideous and we do not allow that kind of content on Facebook,\" a spokeswoman for the company said.\"We take our responsibility to keep people safe on Facebook very seriously and will remove videos that depict sexual assault and are shared to glorify violence.\"In January, Chicago police arrested four people in which a man\'s alleged assault was live streamed, also on Facebook Live.',tech

'Shipping slump: Why a vessel worth $60m was sold as scrap In January 2010, the container ship Hammonia Grenada was delivered from a Chinese yard to its new owners, reportedly priced at about $60m (about £37m at that time). Just seven years later - at the start of this year - it was sold for scrap. The price: an estimated $5. 5m (£4. 4m today). It\'s not the only vessel to suffer this fate. Last year container ships were sold at rock-bottom prices for scrap in record numbers. The simple reason is that there are too many ships for too little cargo. The most dramatic casualty was , which collapsed last August weighed down by debts. The container shipping industry, and Hanjin in particular, has been spectacularly wrong about the financial crisis - twice. There was not one but two waves of container ship ordering in 2010, and then again in 2013-14. Interest rates were low and money was cheap. The result - a massive oversupply of vessels.\"The attitude in the industry was when you were not making profits the best thing to do was to cut costs, and the best way to cut costs is to increase scale, buying bigger and more fuel-efficient ships,\" explains Rahul Kapoor, director at shipping consultancy Drewry Financial Research Services.\"Before 2008 and 2009 the world had been growing consistently, and after 10 years of growth no-one in the shipping industry expected demand to shrink so fast. \"To start with they thought it was just a blip. But in reality it was structural, and they totally missed the structural problems.\"The Panama effect And there was another reason to buy - and to buy big: the Panama Canal. Last year it got . The old locks could take container ships up to only 5, 000 TEU (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Unit, roughly one container). These are known as Panamaxes. But the new locks, with gates weighing 700 tonnes or more, are designed to take so called Neo-Panamaxes. These are giants, equivalent to the width and length of three football pitches laid end to end, and can carry about 13, 000 TEU. So shippers looking to carry cargoes from Asia to the American east coast ports, can now take Neo-Panamaxes through the new canal - and sell off their smaller Panamaxes. That\'s why Panamaxes like the Hammonia Grenada are going cheap - in fact, they\'re going nowhere. If you want to charter one, , it will cost you less than half of what it did a year ago. Andrew Scorer of S&amp; P Platts says: \"You have a steady trickle of ships going to the scrap yard under the blowtorch, but you have these bigger TEU ships with bigger capacity, and they\'re going to be ruling the waves for now.\"Upgrading Meanwhile, ports are modernising to take the bigger cargoes. Baltimore, Charleston, Miami, New York and Savannah are all updating facilities to accommodate the Neo-Panamaxes. For instance, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey plans to spend $2. 7bn on enlarging its terminals and shipping lanes, and a further $1. 3bn to raise a bridge by 20 metres to get the monsters through. But the fundamental problem of oversupply has not gone away. According to the global fleet of all types of commercial shipping is 50\% larger than it was before the financial crisis. In contrast, the says growth in global trade has been much smaller, creeping up from $14. 3 trillion in 2007 to $16. 7tn in 2015, an increase of just 15\%. Turning point It\'s not necessarily all doom and gloom. In fact, Drewry\'s latest suggests the market could actually be at a turning point. It believes the problem of too many ships for too little cargo is now set to improve, and forecasts global freight rates will increase by 12\% this year after four years of decline. But the reality is that the slowing in global trade may have more profound causes - not to do with shipping or economic growth, but to do with how and what we consume. Last year, Mr Kapoor wrote a report for Drewry\'s using the example of his son\'s excitement at buying the Pokemon Go app and comparing his own habits 15 years earlier. While his son was happy to buy something electronic, back in Mr Kapoor\'s youth he would have bought something physical that may well have been shipped in a container from Asia.\"In an increasingly knowledge based and services driven global economic expansion, the trade expansion is stagnating,\" he wrote.\"The global manufacturing engines, world trade, credit driven GDP growth model is being increasingly challenged and world trade seems to be stuck in a time warp, barely growing.\"',business
'Record Store Day: Our pick of 10 of the best releases Ever wanted the new Little Mix album on pink vinyl? Then you\'re in luck. The band are releasing a special neon edition of Glory Days for Record Store Day 2017, in the hope it will tempt you into a nearby vinyl emporium. They\'re among 500-plus artists supporting the 10th Record Store Day - the annual event celebrating independent record shops - with David Bowie, Madonna and Babymetal all joining the fun. Best of all, Aqua are celebrating 20 years of Barbie Girl by re-issuing their global smash in a plastic sleeve. Why? Because \"life in plastic, it\'s fantastic\". has just been published and, as usual, it mixes must-have exclusives with brain-scrambling obscurities by bands you\'ve probably never heard of. Luckily, we\'ve ploughed through it so you don\'t have to. Here are 10 of the records you might actually want to track down on Saturday 22 April. David Bowie: Cracked Actor A year after Bowie\'s death, and the vaults are slowly being opened. Cracked Actor (Live in Los Angeles 1974) is a three-album set recorded on the so-called \"Philly Dogs\" leg of his Diamond Dogs tour - the same show that was captured in an infamous BBC documentary of the same name. Over five sides of vinyl, you\'ll hear material from Diamond Dogs and Aladdin Sane; as well as a handful of tracks intended for (but eventually dropped from) the soul-inflected Young Americans, which was released the following year. The set is completely different to Bowie\'s patchy 1974 concert album David Live - and features a brand new band, including Luther Vandross on backing vocals. The sixth side of the three-album set features an etching of Bowie. Madonna - Dance Mix EP A worldwide release for a mid-80s Argentinean EP, featuring Into The Groove, Vacacion (Holiday) and extended mixes of Angel and Chica Material (Material Girl). The artwork will authentically replicate the original, which changes hands for about £200 in the second-hand market. Doctor Who and the Pescatons The first-ever Doctor Who audio drama, this features Tom Baker as the Doctor and Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, defending London from a violent attack by the Pescatons, a race of humanoid sharks, who crash land in the Thames Estuary on a meteorite. As you do. The double album also features a second disc of classic sound effects from Doctor Who. Bruce Springsteen: Hammersmith Odeon, London \'75 When Bruce Springsteen flew into London for his first-ever UK show, he was greeted by posters declaring \"FINALLY! London is ready for Bruce Springsteen\". Enraged, he ran around the Hammersmith Odeon destroying them all. \"My business is SHOW business not TELLING. You show people and let them decide,\" he fumed in his autobiography, released last year. That energy fuelled his performance, which went down in history as one of The Boss\'s most incendiary performances (although Springsteen himself, wracked with doubt, felt otherwise). Released as a live album and DVD in 2006, it gets its first vinyl outing for this year\'s Record Store Day. The Comet Is Coming: Death To The Planet This is a brand new, four-track EP by the London-based trio, which they describe as the \"sound of total planetary destruction, produced with laser-guided accuracy and aimed directly at the dancefloor\". The songs will not initially be available to download or stream - so this is the only way to hear the new material. For now. Deee-Lite: Groove Is In The Heart Perhaps the ultimate sampladelic psych-pop disco party song, this has been out of print on vinyl ever since it was (contentiously) denied the number one spot by the Steve Miller Band\'s Joker in 1990. Re-released as a solid pink 12\", the song is backed by the original B-side, What Is Love? The Fall: Masquerade (PWL mix) AKA The moment when Manchester\'s angular, vinegary post-punk hero Mark E Smith met 80s pop overlords Stock Aitken and Waterman. Masquerade was originally a track on The Fall\'s 19th album, Levitate, but was re-recorded and remixed in February 1998 to coincide with Smith receiving the Godlike Genius award at the NME Awards. On the b-side was a remix from Stock Aitken Waterman\'s in-house team of Jason Barron and Richie Reed. A sought-after rarity, it\'s being released for the first time ever on 7\". The Smiths: Boy With The Thorn In His Side A prime example of what Record Store Day is all about - The Smiths releasing a previously unheard version of one of their best singles. The limited edition 7\" also contains an early version of Rubber Ring, the original b-side to Boy With The Thorn In His Side. The release is an early sample of the material being unearthed for a reissue of The Smiths\' seminal album The Queen Is Dead next year. Johnny Cash: The Johnny Cash Children\'s Album It\'s a long journey from \"I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die,\" to \"There\'s a little green fountain on a little green mountain\" but Johnny Cash went there on this, his 49th album. Available on vinyl for the first time since 1975, it\'s worth a listen just for Cash\'s self-penned and scientifically-inaccurate Dinosaur Song, in which the country star imagines opening his very own Jurassic Park.\"\" he asks. \"\"\"\"\"Truly bizarre. Bastille: Comfort of Strangers A brand new song from Dan and the Bastille Boys, this was recorded during sessions for their number one album, Wild World, last year. Given the band\'s literary and cinematic proclivities, it\'s entirely likely that the lyrics were inspired by Ian McEwan\'s disturbing horror / thriller of the same name. The B-side is a live version of fan favourite Warmth, which gave Wild World its title; and the whole package comes on white vinyl, with a holographic sleeve. Fancy. Ten more to look out for - The first configuration of the band\'s seminal Never Mind The Bollocks album, with slightly different versions of the key tracks and completely different artwork. - A completely new version of the band\'s 13th album, featuring alternate versions of every song, including Hold Me and Gypsy. Available for the first time on vinyl. - Kate Nash\'s first new material since 2013; following her well-received appearance at the SXSW festival last week. - A full recording of the star\'s already-legendary 2016 shows at the Royal Albert Hall, backed by members of Arctic Monkeys and Queens Of The Stone Age A full, 15-minute version of the Pink Floyd instrumental, released for the first time on one-sided black vinyl with a fold-out poster. - Reissues of seven classic Prince singles, including Sign O\' The Times, Batdance and Pop Life, with the original B-sides and remixes. Little Red Corvette will also be re-released as a 7\" picture disc. - A deconstructed version of the punk poet\'s latest album, with just the beats on one vinyl and just the spoken word on the other. - A box set of the band\'s first 10 singles, including Blitzkrieg Bop and Sheena Was A Punk Rocker. A three-track cassette featuring early versions of the songs Sir Paul wrote with Elvis Costello in 1987. - One of the few grime releases for Record Store Day, this is a white label vinyl of Wiley\'s current, and allegedly final, album. Record Store Day takes place on Saturday 22 April. BBC Radio 6 Music will premiere a selection of the exclusives in the week leading up to the event, culminating in a live broadcast from Vinyl Tap in Huddersfield on Friday, 21 April, hosted by Lauren Laverne. BBC Radio 3\'s Record Review will also celebrate the initiative with a live show at Spiritland, a listening cafe just north of King\'s Cross in London, on the day itself. ',entertainment
'Why is Pakistan\'s Musharraf on TV? Pakistan\'s controversial former military ruler, Pervez Musharraf, has launched a television show commenting on current affairs. The weekly show began on the Pakistani TV channel Bol last month. So far the former leader has called for closer ties with the US, criticised Pakistan\'s civilian government and attacked India. But his move raises many questions about his motives, and how\'s it being received in Pakistan? What\'s behind the move? Many retired military officials have morphed into security analysts after retirement, but Mr Musharraf is the highest-ranking official to go down that route. He also scored a first in 2013 when he became the first-ever Pakistani army chief to form a political party of his own and file nominations to contest general elections. But the electoral goal remains unfulfilled - he was banned from running and became embroiled in legal cases, eventually leaving the country for Dubai a year ago, ostensibly to seek medical attention. Many believe this unfulfilled political ambition may be the driving force behind Mr Musharraf\'s reinvention as a television intellectual. What kind of show is it? The programme, which goes out each Sunday, is called Sab Se Pehle Pakistan (Pakistan First) with President Musharraf. The line comes from Mr Musharraf\'s most popular political slogan during his time in power. A young female host, Shenaya Siddiqui, asks for his opinions on a range of political, military, economic and even entertainment issues. Mr Musharraf answers the questions from Dubai. This format is not unique - several channels hire journalists to comment on current affairs - but this is the first such programme to use a former leader. Editorially, Bol comes across as a staunchly pro-military, anti-India and anti-liberal news channel. It also appears to be trying to expand its audience by giving prominent politicians their own shows. Over the weekend it launched what it said would be a weekly current affairs programme featuring former president Asif Ali Zardari, who played a pivotal role in forcing Mr Musharraf from office. What\'s Musharraf been saying? So far the top lines have largely related to Pakistan\'s diplomatic ties and its security challenges. The former army chief has talked of Pakistan\'s geo-strategic importance and has called for good relations with Washington. He\'s also suggested Pakistan should not consider Israel an eternal enemy, but rather a country Pakistan has differences with over the Palestinian question. On India, he has adopted a hard line, saying it poses an existential threat to Pakistan but cannot defeat it militarily. Domestically, he has been critical of the military\'s operation against Islamic militants, saying troops are chopping off the branches but not the trunk. He blames the civilian government for this, saying it has political contacts with sectarian groups. That might raise a few eyebrows - many will recall that the former president himself was accused of playing a double game over militants for years. How\'s the show been received? Many believe that Bol is trying to be provocative to draw viewers. And critics point out that Mr Musharraf is not objective. They point to his role in the proliferation of militancy in the region, while accepting US funds to fight them. As Pakistan\'s army chief he scuttled a possible rapprochement with India by launching the Kargil war in 1999. He then toppled Pakistan\'s elected government the same year. Researcher and author Ayesha Siddiqa says Mr Musharraf\'s TV career shows he is \"driven by ego\".\"His political ambitions have been dashed for now, but he is telling himself that he still matters. And he wants to use this opportunity to mouth a narrative that has damaged the country in the past and continues to do so.\"Ms Siddiqa, who was also targeted in one of Bol\'s programmes, says the channel \"wants to establish itself as one that will represent the military\'s interests… It seeks to be part of a certain kind of publicity that weakens the civilian narrative.\"Bol\'s management refused to comment. Is Musharraf likely to return to Pakistan soon? Mr Musharraf was forced to step down as president in 2008 and went into exile. He returned in 2013 to contest the general election, but soon faced a raft of charges - including two counts of murder, over the death of Benazir Bhutto and a Baloch tribal leader, and high treason - relating to his time in power. But he was then allowed to leave for Dubai for medical treatment. Many believe Pakistan\'s powerful security establishment played a role in orchestrating his departure. Recently, however, he\'s talked of returning once more to play an active role in politics. He has also been discussing possible political alliances with other groups. His aides say he faces a threat to his life but would come back to face the court cases if his security could be guaranteed. Do people support him? Back in 2013, he hoped to win some seats in parliament, especially in the northern region where his investment in infrastructure had made him popular. But his disqualification and subsequent house arrest rendered his party dysfunctional for all practical purposes. It remains redundant and it is not clear if the leadership has any plans to rejuvenate it by forging alliances and drawing up a new charter. The BBC\'s attempts to obtain the party\'s views were not successful. Many people believe Mr Musharraf has agreed to appear on his own TV show as a path back into politics. Only time will tell if it helps propel him back into the national conversation.',politics
'eBay launches guaranteed three-day delivery in US Online retailer eBay has promised to get items to US shoppers in three days or less with a new programme called \"Guaranteed Delivery\". From the summer, the site will guarantee the speedy delivery of 20 million products from certain sellers who currently meet delivery promises. If items don\'t arrive on time, eBay will refund shipping or give shoppers a voucher if delivery was free. One analyst questioned whether the move would appeal to eBay customers.\"It comes as something of a surprise,\" said Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global. \"Quite a lot of what is purchased through eBay is discretionary, it\'s not usually urgent health or food products, for example.\"Another new feature will allow buyers to filter products that will arrive even more quickly - within one or two days\' time - when browsing the site. Trusting the seller EBay currently relies on millions of sellers - from individuals to larger businesses - to organise deliveries.\"There are so many great sellers on eBay delivering an incredible shipping experience where they deliver in two days, and even next day, so the ability to highlight will further increase customer confidence and satisfaction,\" said Brett Thome, who runs VMInnovations, which sells products via eBay. The new move depended on sellers being able to stick to the promised delivery times, said Mr Roberts.\"It does involve them putting a bit of faith in their vendors,\" he told the BBC, \"but it could pay off for eBay and enhance their position.\"The site has experimented with fast delivery promises before, with varying success.

'London Stock Exchange/Deutsche Boerse merger in doubt The 29bn euro (£24. 5bn) merger of the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse could collapse after the LSE said the deal was unlikely to be approved by the European Commission. The commission had ordered the LSE to sell its 60\% stake in MTS, a fixed-income trading platform. However, the LSE said the request was \"disproportionate\". It warned investors it would struggle to sell MTS and that such a sale would harm its ongoing business. As a result, the LSE said: \"Based on the commission\'s current position, LSE believes that the commission is unlikely to provide clearance for the merger.\" The two rival exchanges announced about a year ago, aiming to create a giant trading powerhouse that would better compete against US rivals. They had already agreed to sell part of LSE\'s clearing business, LCH, to satisfy competition concerns before the commission\'s surprise demand concerning MTS earlier this month. The Commission had given the exchanges until Monday to come up with a proposal to meet that demand. LSE said that such a sale would need regulatory approval from several European governments and would hurt its wider Italian business.\"Taking all relevant factors into account, and acting in the best interests of shareholders, the LSE Board today concluded that it could not commit to the divestment of MTS,\" the exchange . Analysis Dominic O\'Connell, Today business presenter When the London Stock Exchange trumpeted its merger with Deutsche Boerse last year, the chairman, Donald Brydon, was remarkably relaxed about the Brexit vote. He and his German counterparts said the deal would go ahead regardless of the outcome. What they didn\'t know was that it would eventually fall foul of another aspect of the single market - Brussels\' control of competition laws. The two sides have made no bones about the fact the merger would create a company with a powerful presence in key markets, and have offered a number of sops to competition authorities in an attempt to win their approval. But it was not enough; Brussels insisted the LSE cede control of MTS, an important Italian clearing house with a crucial role in the trading of Italian government debt. For the LSE board, this was a step too far. A sale of MTS would be too harmful, the directors decided, and they have chosen not to meet an European deadline to say how they would get rid of it. The Brits say they want to go ahead with the merger, but it looks like an insurmountable obstacle. The LSE will either go it alone in a post-Brexit world, or - as has often seemed possible before, and even more so now - fall into the arms of one of the giant American exchanges.\'Good news\' MTS is a relatively small part of LSE\'s business, but it is a major platform for trading European government bonds, particularly in Italy, where it is classified as a \"systemically important regulated business\". The LSE group also owns the Milan-based Borsa Italiana. The LSE said it remained convinced about the merits of a merger, but joining forces with Deutsche Boerse would be impossible unless the commission changed its stance. Deutsche Boerse said on Sunday night that it and the LSE would await a further assessment by the European Commission, which was expected to make a decision by the end of March. Syed Kamall, MEP for London and a member of the European Parliament\'s financial services committee, told the BBC: \"I think this is good news for competition, and it\'s also good news for those who are worried that some business in London might be moved to Frankfurt via the back door.\"The European Commission declined to comment. Shares in the London Stock Exchange fell 3\% on the news. ',business

According to , the briefing note was found on the floor of a first-class carriage on a train heading from Manchester to Edinburgh in January. The document identified details such as a private address where Theresa May was attending a dinner that evening. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said they had been made aware of the claims. The two-page briefing note was found by a member of the public at around midday on the day of the trip, the Mirror said. \'Serious security breach\' It detailed Mrs May\'s plans for the day when she visited north-west England for a regional cabinet meeting.

'Small drone \'shot with Patriot missile\' A Patriot missile - usually priced at about $3m (£2. 5m) - was used to shoot down a small quadcopter drone, according to a US general. The strike was made by a US ally, Gen David Perkins .\"That quadcopter that cost 200 bucks from Amazon. com did not stand a chance against a Patriot,\" he said. Patriots are radar-targeted weapons more commonly used to shoot down enemy aircraft and ballistic missiles.\"Now, that worked, they got it, OK, and we love Patriot missiles,\" the general said. Recently, there have been reports that some groups, , have taken to attaching weapons to small, commercial drones and using them against security forces.

'Petrol and diesel prices cut amid pressure on retailers Motorists will see an acceleration in fuel price cuts over the weekend as supermarkets take up to 2p off a litre of petrol and diesel. Wholesale prices have dropped and motoring organisations have suggested this merits reduced pump prices. Tesco and Morrisons are cutting prices by 2p a litre on Friday, and Asda and Sainsbury\'s said they would reduce prices by up to 2p a litre on Saturday. But drivers are being warned that prices can vary in different areas. The average UK price for a litre of unleaded petrol was 118. 83p on Thursday, and 120. 88p for a litre of diesel, according to the latest figures from Experian Catalist. Ten days earlier, the average unleaded price was 120p a litre, and diesel cost 122. 06p.\'Shop around\' The oil price and wholesale prices fell sharply at the start of March, and motoring organisations have argued that this should have been feeding through to another 2p cut per litre in prices at the pumps. The RAC said motorists could feel \"aggrieved\" that prices had not fallen further, earlier. Asda said it had dropped prices twice in two weeks, and had a national price cap to ensure motorists were dealt with equitably. Morrisons said it had also made a second cut in two weeks. Tesco is dropping petrol and diesel prices by 2p a litre over the course of Friday afternoon at all its outlets, followed by Sainsbury\'s on Saturday. Luke Bosdet, of the AA, said that there was general concern that so-called supermarket fuel price wars did not actually benefit all drivers across the country. He claimed prices fell the most in areas where there were a range of supermarkets located close to each other. In other areas with less competition, the same cuts were not as likely to be seen.\"We would urge motorists to look around to find a better price.

'The frock stars who rocked - and shocked - at the Oscars The eyes of the fashion world will be on the red carpet at the Academy Awards on Sunday to see what gowns - and suits - will be turning people\'s heads. How many of this year\'s attendees, though, will try to top the outfits of the past that made a lasting impression - and not always for the best reasons? One of the most outrageous gowns in Oscar history must surely be the infamous dress that Icelandic pop star swanned in on in 2001.

'Article 50: Is Whitehall ready for Brexit? If you walk down Whitehall in central London, you cannot escape reminders of wars fought and empires run from this small district on the north bank of the Thames. There are memorials to the fallen, statues of field marshals and even a Turkish cannon captured in some long-forgotten conflict. Yet the civil service that once gloried in its global administrative stretch is now the smallest it has been since World War Two. And with the government launching the British state on its greatest administrative, economic and legal reform since it committed the nation to total war in 1939, there is a simple question: is Whitehall up for Brexit? \"It\'s been a scramble but the ducks are in a row,\" one Cabinet minister told me confidently. For the scale of the challenge is immense. Thousands of civil servants to be mobilised and retasked, thousands of laws and regulations to be rewritten or rejected and thousands of people trained and employed to do the many things currently carried out by the European Union. This endeavour is not only about the two years of initial negotiations with 27 EU member states that will shortly begin, it is also about the mammoth preparations the UK must make for leaving the EU whatever the outcome of the negotiations.\"The challenge of Brexit has few, if any, parallels in its complexity,\" says Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary. \"Its full implications and impact on the political, economic and social life of the country... will probably only become clear from the perspective of future decades.\" Perhaps the greatest challenge the civil service has faced was its utter lack of preparation for the British people voting out in the referendum last June. They were expressly forbidden from drawing up any plans by David Cameron\'s administration and have been playing catch up ever since. Ministers say the civil service has responded well, creating two new government departments from a standing start. The Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) has something north of 320 staff, the Department for International Trade, several thousand. Both departments, along with the Foreign Office, have been given an extra £400m by the Treasury over the next four years to pay for their work on Brexit. There were some initial turf wars but officials now say there is greater singularity of purpose. Much work has been done analysing options, quantifying markets and assessing laws. Huge volumes of paper have been landing on DExEU desks looking at the impact of Brexit on every aspect of the economy. The aim is to allow David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, to draw up an a la carte menu for the prime minister, setting out potential options and costs so that she can navigate the negotiations ahead. For there is no doubt that these will be Theresa May\'s negotiations. The main negotiating team will include Mr Davis, his permanent secretary, Olly Robbins, and Sir Tim Barrow, the UK permanent representative to the EU. Below them will be civil servants from all affected government departments, summoned in to work on specific \"chapters\" of the negotiations, on everything from fish to agriculture to financial services. They will be the team dealing with the European Commission negotiators on an almost daily basis. Yet above them will be Mrs May who will have to drive the talks and make the big calls. But such is the size of the task that even the prime minister will struggle to retain her usual iron grip. One minister told me: \"This is the first big test to see if she can delegate. This is so big that No 10 cannot control it, they cannot be on top of all the detail.\" Not all are so sanguine about the preparedness of Whitehall. The National Audit Office says in a new report that, while 1, 000 new roles have been created in the civil service to deal with Brexit, a third remain unfilled and most of the new appointees have simply been transferred from other parts of government. And the Institute for Government warns that departments such as the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are underfunded, cannot afford more staff and will be forced to drop non-Brexit work. Other insiders warn that, although much work has been done setting out options, less thought has been devoted to how the negotiations will progress themselves and how the government should organise itself. Officials talk of not knowing precisely for what they are preparing because Downing Street refuses to reveal its negotiating plans. The process, inevitably, will begin with negotiations about the negotiations. Who will talk to whom, about what and in what order? The UK government wants to discuss its divorce from the EU at the same time as its future trade relationship. The EU says the two issues must remain separate. Then will come the exit agreement itself. Much will be visceral and hard-fought. Protecting the rights of EU nationals in the UK and vice versa sounds easy as both sides say they want this to be resolved early on and want to keep the status quo. But the hugely complex detail will be hard to agree. Yet sorting that out might be easy compared to agreeing how much money, if any, the UK will owe the EU when it leaves. The government says nothing, the EU is hinting at £50bn. And all this is before any negotiations about any future trade arrangement between the UK and the EU and any transitional process that may be needed. While this will generate a huge amount of work for some in the civil service, many other officials will be focused instead on preparing the UK for leaving the EU come what may. Much of this will focus on Westminster. There is the Great Repeal Bill to be written and passed through Parliament to ensure that all EU law is transferred automatically into UK law the moment we leave. The aim is to ensure there is no legal chaos and to allow Parliament all the time it needs gradually to unstitch the UK from four decades of EU legislation. This will be a massive piece of legislative work that will require officials to re-examine huge swathes of UK law. They will have to decide which bits of EU law to return to Westminster and which bits are devolved, a tricky issue in light of Holyrood\'s demand for a second independence referendum. The Institute for Government warns there might be a need for further 15 separate Brexit Bills. In the short term, there are a huge number of separate parliamentary inquiries into Brexit - 55 in all - being carried out by various committees of MPs and peers. Ministers have to reply to each one within 60 days and officials are struggling to meet that deadline. Then there is the process of the UK re-establishing its status at the World Trade Organization (WTO), something that will be needed even if we get a new trade deal with the EU. The government hopes to transfer its current EU tariff rates into a new UK-specific schedule of trade commitments. But such a \"copy and paste\" arrangement will be complicated and will almost certainly face challenge from other WTO members. UK diplomats in Geneva, where the WTO is based, have a hard job of reassurance ahead of them. And then there is also the process of creating new organisations that will fill the gaps in our national life left as the EU tide ebbs from our shores. Officials will need to set up new customs and immigration systems, neither of which will be simple or easy. So, as the phoney war ends with the triggering of Article 50, Whitehall is facing perhaps its greatest challenge in a generation. ',politics
'IBM gives out-of-office patent to public IBM has been granted a patent for its out-of-office email system but has promised that it won\'t enforce it. The \"invention\", officially recognised in January, as \"stupid patent of the month\". The patent was filed in 2010 at a time when many tech firms made grabs for all kinds of technological innovations. IBM said that it would \"dedicate the patent to the public\". It has led to accusations that the US Patent Office (USPTO) is out of touch. In a statement, the IBM said that it had notified \"the USPTO that it foregoes its rights to the patent. As a result, the patent is released into the public domain\". Holiday postcard The described patent included details such as how a user needed to input \"availability such as a start date, an end date and at least one availability indicator message\". The only feature of the system that differs from existing out-of-office systems is one that automatically notifies people a few days before the person goes on holiday so that they can prepare for a colleague\'s absence, according to EFF. It likened this change to \"asking for a patent on the idea of sending a postcard, not from a vacation, but to let someone know you will go on a vacation\". It also criticised the US Patent Office for granting such a patent.\"It never considered any of the many, many existing real-world systems that pre-dated IBM\'s application,\" it writes. Patent bonanza There has been widespread criticism of patents being granted for abstract ideas rather than for brand new technical advances. Chris Price, a UK and European patent lawyer at law firm EIP, said of the time taken to grant the patent: \"Seven years does seem a little bit on the long side but it is by no means unusual for it to take that long to grant patents.\"He added: \"In Europe, patents are granted for inventions that solve technical problems and if they are seen to address something that is business-related or an administrative process they are not given. In the US the situation is historically more permissive.\"Earlier this year IBM announced that it had broken the US patent record with more than 8, 000 patents granted to its inventors in 2016. This marks the 24th consecutive year that it has won the title.

'State of Sport: Amateur doping findings \'concern\' sports minister The extent of doping in amateur sport - revealed by a poll for the BBC - is a \"concern\", says sports minister Tracey Crouch. A BBC State of Sport investigation found more than a third (35\%) of amateur sports people say they personally know someone who has doped. Half said performance-enhancing substance use is \"widespread\" among those who play competitive sport. Crouch said doping was \"absolutely unacceptable in any level of sport\". She added: \"I think there is still more that sports governing bodies can do on this front, working alongside UK Anti-Doping, to help promote clean sport.\"The investigation into doping in UK amateur sport also found 8\% of amateur sports people said they had taken steroids, while 49\% thought performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) were \"easily available\" among people who play sports regularly. Nicole Sapstead, chief executive of UK Anti-Doping (Ukad), the body responsible for protecting clean sport, had earlier described the figures as \"incredibly alarming\". She called for more resources to tackle doping, saying it was \"fast becoming a crisis\" at all levels of sport. Crouch added: \"These findings from the BBC are a concern.\"It is important that all involved in sport play their part in educating participants about the dangers of doping, both in terms of the damage it does to sport\'s integrity but also the health risks to individuals as well.\" Would more testing help? Ukad has an annual budget of about &pound; 7m, which is mainly state funding. A single drug test costs about &pound; 350. Ukad directs the vast majority of its testing to elite sport and does not \"have the resources\" to test at lower levels of sport, says director of operations He told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme the research was \"robust\" and added: \"We see lots of young people, young men in particular, who choose to use these substances for image enhancement, but this creeps across into sport as many of them will be involved in amateur sport.\"I don\'t think it\'s helpful to criminalise amateur sports people whatsoever - the way forward is to tackle the supply of these substances and take action against those who profit and make criminal money by supplying them.\" who ran the UK\'s anti-doping organisation between 1986 and 2004, said she was concerned the BBC Sport research could be \"turned into a plea for more money\" for anti-doping, arguing testing is \"quite limited in its effectiveness\".\"Do we want to extend testing down to an amateur level so we could actually be dissuading people from getting involved in sport?\" she said on the Victoria Derbyshire programme.\"It would be inappropriate in a society where we have an obesity crisis and a concern with lack of physical activity that we suddenly start testing at an amateur level.\"We don\'t know at elite level how much is enough. We tested Lance Armstrong and Marion Jones extensively and never tested them positive. We need smarter testing.\"American cyclist Armstrong, 45, was stripped of his record seven Tour de France titles and in August 2012 for what the United States Anti-Doping Agency described as \"the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen\". Compatriot Jones, 41, won gold in the 100m and 200m at the 2000 Olympics but in January 2008 for lying about steroid use and involvement in a drugs fraud case.

I looked around the gym and the other guys were getting ahead of me and I wondered why. Peer pressure was one of the reasons I took them.\"The side-effects have been everlasting.

We\'re big fans of pizza, Stormz, so we\'ll see you at the Italian round the corner later. His ascent to number one was helped a great deal by his own campaigning on social media. As the week progressed, he started retweeting more and more of his fans who had bought the album on CD - a format which influences the chart more than streaming. But the album also achieved the most first week streams for a number one in chart history, according to the Official Charts Company. Here are seven things you need to know about this now record-breaking rapper. \"I was working on an oil refinery in quality assurance,\" he .\"It was quite a niche job, so they had to train me up for 10 months. I was in the office, doing the quality checks. It was a lot of responsibility for the age I was.\"But, as it turned out, it wasn\'t for him.\"The music was picking up, so I had to make the decision - project engineer or musician. I decided to take the music path and here we are.\" Last year, Stormzy criticised the Brit Awards for its lack of ethnic minority nominees in his track One Take Freestyle. It led to the Brits chairman Ged Doherty inviting him to discuss how grime could be better represented at the ceremony.\"We had a very very constructive talk, he showed me the categories of eligibility, I told him how these could be improved,\" Stormzy said. In turn, this year\'s nominations list was much more diverse, with four out of the five nominees for best male not being white.(In the end, the only white nominee, David Bowie, won in that category. But still, baby steps.)Stormzy himself was nominated for best breakthrough act this year and performed with Ed Sheeran at the ceremony. The Brits appearance helped to give him a boost in sales this week - and he wasn\'t the only one. Emeli Sande and Bruno Mars also saw a huge increase in sales after their performances. We\'re used to US musicians regularly referencing God in their music and their awards acceptance speeches. But it\'s less common for religion to crop up heavily in the lyrics of UK grime artists. In Blinded by your Grace Part 2, he sings: \"Lord I\'ve been broken / Although I\'m not worthy / You fixed me, now I\'m blinded by your grace / You came and saved me.\"This is maybe a good example of why his album reaches out beyond the usual confines of the genre. \"The strangest place I\'ve been recognised was actually Amsterdam,\" he told the BBC.\"I went there with a few of my mates and it wasn\'t even just the one person, it was a few people going \'Oh, Stormzy\'s in Amsterdam\', and I was thinking, \'No way, you know me out here\'.\"\"I went to pick up my nephew from primary school and one of the teachers there stopped me and said, \'Yeah, my son listens to you\'. That\'s quite an awkward thing. Quite surreal.\" We mentioned earlier that Stormzy took issue with the Brits for its previous lack of diversity, which perhaps speaks to a wider issue within the music industry about the struggle of grime to break through into the mainstream. So Stormzy took things into his own hands, and released his debut album (the one that\'s just reached number one) through his own independent label Merky Records. He\'s not the first artist to have done this recently - Skepta did the same thing, as did Chance the Rapper in the US. Which is pretty impressive.\"My time at school, I was quite smart in school so I got good grades, but I was also a bit of a class clown,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\"I was playing that fine borderline between getting excluded but the teachers kind of loving me, but I had a great time in school. As a child, Stormzy was also quite a bookworm - he also told the programme how he used to collect badges from his school library for every book he read over the summer. He is actually called Michael Omari. Also, he calls his mum \"Mumsy\". Stormzy and Mumzy. Amazing. ',entertainment
'Scottish independence: Nicola Sturgeon to seek second referendum Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed she will ask for permission to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence. Ms Sturgeon said she wanted a vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and the spring of the following year. That would coincide with the expected conclusion of the UK\'s Brexit negotiations. The Scottish first minister said the move was needed to protect Scottish interests in the wake of the UK voting to leave the EU. She will ask the Scottish Parliament next Tuesday to request a Section 30 order from Westminster. The order would be needed to allow a fresh legally-binding referendum on independence to be held. Prime Minister Theresa May has so far avoided saying whether or not she would grant permission. Responding to Ms Sturgeon\'s announcement, Mrs May said a second independence referendum would set Scotland on course for \"uncertainty and division\" and insisted that the majority of people in Scotland did not want another vote on the issue. She added: \"The tunnel vision that SNP has shown today is deeply regrettable. \"Instead of playing politics with the future of our country, the Scottish government should focus on delivering good government and public services for the people of Scotland. Politics is not a game.\" But speaking at her official Bute House residence in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said the people of Scotland must be offered a choice between a \"hard Brexit\" and becoming an independent country. The Scottish government has published proposals which it says would allow Scotland to remain a member of the European single market even if the rest of the UK leaves, which Mrs May has said it will. Analysis by Brian Taylor, BBC Scotland\'s political editor Several questions now arise? Does Nicola Sturgeon have a mandate for today\'s decision? She says yes, unquestionably. In defence of this, she says that the SNP won the last Holyrood election with a record share of the constituency vote. Against that, rivals say the SNP did not retain their overall majority at Holyrood. Countering that again, it might be noted that there is a majority at Holyrood for independence, including the Greens. As will be demonstrated next week when those two parties vote together to urge a Section 30 transfer from Westminster. Which brings us to Question Two. Section 30 refers to the portion of the 1998 Scotland Act, the Holyrood founding statute, which permits the transfer of other powers from the reserved section to the devolved criterion. It has been used, for example, to transfer control over issues like rail transport to Holyrood. It was used, most significantly, to transfer power to hold the 2014 referendum, with agreement over the wording of questions and the timing of the plebiscite. Will the UK government agree to a transfer this time around? Not without detailed examination and negotiation. The first minister said the UK government had not \"moved even an inch in pursuit of compromise and agreement\" since the Brexit referendum, which saw Scotland vote by 62\% to 38\% in favour of Remain while the UK as a whole voted to leave by 52\% to 48\%. On Monday evening, , paving the way for the government to trigger Article 50 so the UK can leave the EU. Peers backed down over the issues of EU residency rights and a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal after their objections were overturned by MPs. Ms Sturgeon said Scotland stood at a \"hugely important crossroads\", and insisted she would continue to attempt to reach a compromise with the UK government. But she added: \"I will take the steps necessary now to make sure that Scotland will have a choice at the end of this process.\"A choice of whether to follow the UK to a hard Brexit, or to become an independent country able to secure a real partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and our own relationship with Europe.\" Ms Sturgeon continued: \"The Scottish government\'s mandate for offering this choice is beyond doubt. \"So next week I will seek the approval of the Scottish Parliament to open discussions with the UK government on the details of a Section 30 order - the procedure that will enable the Scottish Parliament to legislate for an independence referendum.\"Ms Sturgeon said it was \"important that Scotland is able to exercise the right to choose our own future at a time when the options are clearer than they are now, but before it is too late to decide on our own path.\"She said that the detailed arrangements for a referendum - including its timing - should be for the Scottish Parliament to decide. But she said it was important to be \"frank about the challenges we face and clear about the opportunities independence will give us to secure our relationship with Europe, build a stronger and more sustainable economy and create a fairer society.\"Analysis by Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor The UK and Holyrood governments are set for a battle royale over timing over a potential vote. But the question first is whether or not the prime minster is willing to grant a vote. Under the law, Westminster has to grant the referendum; it\'s not just down to the Scottish government. I\'m told Number 10 had carefully worked out \"countermoves\" depending on what the first minister\'s message was this week. Now Sturgeon has made the first big move, it\'s down to the other side to respond. But arguably we have just entered into the most complicated, most fraught, most fundamental period of political uncertainty for our country in a very long time. Sturgeon\'s announcement confirms that it is not just our place in the EU that is changing, but the relationships between our own nations that are at question too. Ms Sturgeon will rely on the pro-independence Scottish Greens to give her plans majority support in the Scottish Parliament. Patrick Harvie, the party\'s co-convener, welcomed the announcement and confirmed the Greens would vote in favour of seeking a Section 30 order. He added: \"The people of Scotland deserve a choice between Hard Brexit Britain and putting our own future in our own hands\". But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Ms Sturgeon had been \"utterly irresponsible\" and had \"given up acting as first minister for all of Scotland\". She added people \"do not want to go back to the division\" of a referendum and that Ms Sturgeon had promised 2014 would be a \"once in a generation\" poll. Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said Scotland was \"already divided enough\" and \"we do not want to be divided again, but that is exactly what another independence referendum would do.\"\'Democratic decision\' But the party\'s UK leader, Jeremy Corbyn, confirmed that his MPs would not attempt to block a request for a Section 30 order. Mr Corbyn said: \"Labour believes it would be wrong to hold another (referendum) so soon and Scottish Labour will oppose it in the Scottish Parliament. \"If, however, the Scottish Parliament votes for one, Labour will not block that democratic decision at Westminster. \"If there is another referendum, Labour will oppose independence because it is not in the interests of any part of the country to break up the UK.\"Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon\'s SNP had been \"working towards this announcement for months\" and were \"determined to contrive a way to ignore their promise that 2014 was \'once in a generation\'.\"He added that there was \"no wide public support for a new and divisive referendum\".',politics

'UK house prices accelerated in February, says the Nationwide UK house prices accelerated in February with property values rising by 4. 5\% in a year, the Nationwide has said. The building society said that house prices were up by 0. 6\% compared with the previous month, bringing the cost of the average home to £205, 846. Both the monthly and annual rise are greater than in January, but the Nationwide does not expect house prices to rocket. It said the outlook for the market was uncertain. It is predicting a 2\% rise in UK house prices over the course of the year. \"We, along with most other forecasters, expect the UK economy to slow through 2017 as heightened uncertainty weighs on business investment and hiring,\" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide\'s chief economist. \"Consumer spending, a key engine of growth in recent quarters, is also likely to be impacted by rising inflation in the months ahead as a result of the weaker pound. \"Nevertheless, in our view a small rise in house prices of around 2\% is more likely than a decline over the course of 2017, since low borrowing costs and the dearth of homes on the market will continue to support prices.\"Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: \"It is fast becoming less a battle of wills than a battle of nerves - the uneasy standoff between cautious buyers and sellers who know they have less competition than usual.\" ',business

'Ministers refuse to bail out Welsh NHS health boards Four health boards which are due to see their overall budget deficits triple in size will not be bailed out, the Welsh Government has said. The boards are forecast to over spend by £146m this year. In one case - Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) - the financial outlook is said to be \"extremely challenging\". The health board, which covers Swansea and Bridgend, said it was attempting to cut agency staff costs. As well as ABMU there are overspends at Betsi Cadwaladr in north Wales, Cardiff and Vale board and Hywel Dda in mid and west Wales. Betsi Cadwaladr\'s deficit is now forecast to be £30m, Hywel Dda £49. 9m, ABMU £35m and Cardiff and Vale £31m for the 2016-17 financial year. The health boards will not face a bill to repay the money, but they will be expected to balance their books in the next financial year. In the previous year, Betsi Cadwaladr and Hywel Dda had a combined deficit of £50m while Cardiff and Vale and ABMU both broke even. Betsi Cadwaladr has been under direct control of the Welsh Government since June 2015. The other three boards were placed under an increased level of scrutiny from ministers last September due to doubts about their ability to tackle the financial challenges they face. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething told BBC Radio\'s Good Morning Wales programme he was \"pretty certain\" services would not be cut \"simply because of money\".\"We\'ll change services but that\'s because we should change some of our services, because they currently don\'t deliver the right value and the best quality,\" he added.\'Unacceptable\' He said the health service had a responsibility to provide \"high-quality care\" and at the same time \"to do more to live within its means\". A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: \"The position in these four health boards is unacceptable, and we have made it clear that we expect them to take action to significantly improve their financial position.\"She said ministers will not approve financial plans \"that do not deliver such improvements\".\"Individual organisations that exceed their allocated resources, have not - and will not - be bailed out,\" she said, adding that the government is \"working alongside all organisations to improve their respective positions\" and that the \"overall health budget will be balanced for the 2016-17 financial year\". ABMU has gone from a break-even position to a forecast deficit of £39m this year, and another forecast deficit of £53m next year. The health board has average running costs of £3m a day, so a £39m deficit is equivalent to the cost of running the board for 13 days. It said it was focusing on an intensive recruitment drive to cut down on the cost of agency staff, as well as reducing waste in prescription medication. A spokeswoman said: \"There are many challenges facing us when trying to identify savings that won\'t compromise patient safety and quality of care, at the same time as demand on our services increases.\"A spokesman for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said: \"We have worked hard throughout the year, and worked closely with Welsh Government, to address our challenges, and we will continue to do so going forward.\"Stephen Foster, of Hywel Dda University Health Board, said: \"This is not the financial situation that we would want to find ourselves in and we are putting together significant plans to turn it around.\"These figures show a dramatic deterioration in the finances of four out of Wales\' seven health boards. They have also prompted a hard-hitting response from the Welsh Government which, until this point, has been keen to stress how they approach problems together. The tone resembles the approach of the man in charge of the English NHS, Jeremy Hunt, who has not been afraid of calling out heath trusts he believes are under-performing. The Welsh Government has called for a significant improvement in the financial performance. That will be easier said than done in the face of intense pressure on these organisations.',politics
'Apple, Samsung and Microsoft react to Wikileaks\' CIA dump Several of the tech firms whose products have been allegedly compromised by the CIA have given their first reactions to the claims. thousands of documents said to detail the US spy agency\'s hacking tools on Tuesday. They included allegations the CIA had developed ways to listen in on smartphone and smart TV microphones. Apple\'s statement was the most detailed, saying it had already addressed some of the vulnerabilities.\"The technology built into today\'s iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we\'re constantly working to keep it that way,\" it said. \"Our products and software are designed to quickly get security updates into the hands of our customers, with nearly 80\% of users running the latest version of our operating system.\"While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.\"We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security update.\" Samsung - whose F8000 series of televisions was reportedly compromised via a USB connection-based hack co-developed with the UK\'s MI5 agency - was briefer.\"Protecting consumers\' privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung,\" it said.\"We are aware of the report in question and are urgently looking into the matter.\"The leaks also claimed that the CIA had created malware to target PCs running Microsoft\'s Windows operating system.\"We are aware of the report and are looking into it,\" a spokesman from Microsoft said. The documents said that the CIA had also created \"attack and control systems\" that could hijack computers powered by Linux-based software.\"Linux is a very widely used operating system, with a huge installed base all around the world, so it is not surprising that state agencies from many countries would target Linux along with the many closed source platforms that they have sought to compromise,\" Nicko van Someren, chief technology officer at The Linux Foundation told the BBC.\"[But] rapid release cycles enable the open source community to fix vulnerabilities and release those fixes to users faster.\"Google declined to comment about allegations that the CIA was able to \"penetrate, infest and control\" Android phones due to its discovery and acquisition of \"zero day\" bugs - previously unknown flaws in the operating system\'s code. The World Wide Web Foundation - which campaigns for internet privacy - said the US government needed to issue a detailed response.\"Governments should be safeguarding the digital privacy and security of their citizens, but these alleged actions by the CIA do just the opposite,\" said the organisation\'s policy director Craig Fagan.\"Weaponising everyday products such as TVs and smartphones - and failing to disclose vulnerabilities to manufacturers - is dangerous and short-sighted.\"If these new assertions prove true, we call on the Trump administration and other governments to stamp out such practices.\"\'Incredibly damaging\' The CIA has not confirmed whether the documents - said to date between 2013 and 2016 - are real. But one of its former chiefs was concerned by their publication.\"If what I have read is true, then this seems to be an incredibly damaging leak in terms of the tactics, techniques, procedures and tools that were used by the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct legitimate foreign intelligence,\" ex-CIA director Michael Hayden told the BBC.\"In other words, it\'s made my country and my country\'s friends less safe.\"But one expert said the fact that the CIA had targeted such a wide range of technology was no surprise.\"The story here isn\'t that the CIA hacks people. Of course they do; taxpayers would be right to be annoyed if that weren\'t the case,\" blogged Nicholas Weaver, a security researcher at the .\"The CIA\'s job, after all, is [to] collect intelligence, and while its primary purview is human intelligence, hacking systems interacts synergistically with that collection. \"The actual headline here is that someone apparently managed to compromise a Top Secret CIA development environment, exfiltrate a whole host of material, and is now releasing it to the world... now the world wants to know who, and how, and why.\"Embarrassment factor - Analysis by BBC\'s security correspondent Gordon Corera These latest leaks - which appear to give details of highly sensitive technical methods - will be a huge problem for the CIA. There is the embarrassment factor - that an agency whose job is to steal other people\'s secrets has not been able to keep its own. Then there will be the fear of a loss of intelligence coverage against targets who may change their behaviour because they now know what the spies can do. And then there will be the questions over whether the CIA\'s technical capabilities were too expansive and too secret. Because many of the initial documents point to capabilities targeting consumer devices, the hardest questions may revolve around what is known as the \"equities\" problem. This is when you find a vulnerability in a piece of technology and have to balance the benefit to the public of telling the manufacturer so they can close it and improve everyone\'s security with the benefit to the spy agency of leaving it in place so it can be exploited to collect intelligence. The National Security Agency faced questions about whether it had this balance right when many of its secrets were revealed by Edward Snowden, and now it may be the CIA\'s turn.',tech

'Dyson \'enormously optimistic\' about post-Brexit trade Sir James Dyson has said UK business success lies beyond Europe because that is where the fastest growth lies. The billionaire, who was a prominent backer of Brexit, told the BBC he was \"enormously optimistic\" about trading with the rest of the world. His comments came as his engineering firm Dyson reported a 41\% increase in profits to £631m. The popularity of its vacuum cleaners in fast-growing Asian markets was a major reason for the rise. The company said sales of its products increased by 45\% to £2. 5bn, helped by growth of 244\% in China, 266\% in Indonesia and 200\% in the Philippines. The success of new product lines such as hair dryers also fuelled growth.\'Looking outwards\' On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May is due to start the process of the UK leaving the EU. In an interview with the BBC, Sir James said: \"Europe\'s only 15\% of the global market and the really fast-expanding markets are in the Far East.\"I\'m enormously optimistic because looking outwards to the rest of the world is very, very important because that\'s the fast-growing bit.\" Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC Business editor Sir James Dyson is the poster child for the kind of global-facing confidence the government is keen to harness in a week that it signals the beginning of the end of the UK\'s membership of the EU. The entrepreneur has been a prominent supporter of Brexit and remains clear that British business success lies beyond Europe. He is putting his money where his mouth is - investing £2. 5bn, expanding his Wiltshire base by buying 500 acres of old airfield in Hullavington and hoping to double his 3, 500 workforce in the next four years. Critics, though, say that while he designs products in the UK, he manufactures them in the Far East and so his export arrangements may not be subject to the same Brexit uncertainty as for those manufacturing in the UK. \'I\'m a patriot\' Sir James said it would be possible to remain close to Europe after Brexit, while also forging closer ties with Commonwealth countries.\"I\'m a patriot, which is why I\'m rather keen on re-connecting with the Commonwealth,\" he said. And he rejected the suggestion EU staff could be forced to leave the UK - saying it was \"absolute nonsense to suggest countries are going to chuck out foreign citizens\". The entrepreneur, who has criticised the lack of British engineers, also defended his decision to have major operations in Asia, saying the firm\'s intellectual property and profits were still in the UK.\"I\'m resident in England, we pay all our tax here,\" he added. Dyson designs many of its products in the UK, but largely manufactures them in Asia. It has tripled its team in China and recently opened a new £330m research centre in Singapore. The firm is also opening a new multimillion-pound research centre in Wiltshire, England and a university at its existing Malmesbury campus in the Cotswolds.',business

'YouTube: UK government suspends ads amid extremism concerns The government has removed its adverts from YouTube amid concerns they are appearing next to \"inappropriate\" material on the video-sharing site. The Cabinet Office said it was seeking assurances from YouTube\'s owner Google that its messages would be displayed in a \"safe and appropriate way\" in future., Channel 4 and the BBC have also pulled ads citing similar worries.

Ministers have summoned Google for talks at the Cabinet Office after imposing a temporary restriction on its own ads - including for military recruitment and blood donation campaigns - appearing on YouTube.\'Strict guidelines\' The Cabinet Office said digital platforms such as YouTube were a \"cost-effective\" way of reaching mass audiences but the taxpayer demanded high standards and it would be seeking action following recent negative media coverage. \"Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content,\" a spokesman said. \"We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way.\"Google acknowledged its record was not perfect and said it was committed to \"doing better\".\"We have strict guidelines that define where Google ads should appear,\" a spokesman said. \"In the vast majority of cases, our policies work as intended, protecting users and advertisers from harmful or inappropriate content.\"We accept that we don\'t always get it right and that sometimes, ads appear where they should not... We will make changes to our policies and brand controls for advertisers.\"\'Safe environment\' But Channel 4 has questioned whether YouTube remains a \"safe environment\" for advertisers, saying it had removed all its promotions with immediate effect.\"We are extremely concerned about Channel 4 advertising being placed alongside highly offensive material on YouTube,\" said Dan Brooke, the broadcaster\'s chief marketing and communications officer.\"It is a direct contravention of assurances our media buying agency had received on our behalf from YouTube.\"The Guardian has withdrawn all its advertising from both Google and YouTube after it said a promotion for a membership scheme had been inadvertently placed next to extremist material, including videos of American white nationalists, a hate preacher banned in the UK and a controversial Islamist preacher. David Pemsel, the media group\'s chief executive, said the error had been \"completely unacceptable.\"During a recent appearance before the Commons Home Affairs Committee, executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google were told they had a \"terrible reputation\" for dealing with problems and should be policing their content more effectively, given the billions they made.',politics
'Two major US technology firms \'tricked out of $100m\' A Lithuanian man has been charged with tricking two US technology firms into wiring him $100m (£80. 3m) through an email phishing scam. Posing as an Asian-based manufacturer, Evaldas Rimasauskas tricked staff into transferring money into bank accounts under his control, US officials said. The companies were not named but were described as US-based multinationals, with one operating in social media. Officials called it a wake-up call for even \"the most sophisticated\" firms. According to , Mr Rimasauskas, 48 - who was arrested in Lithuania last week - deceived the firms from at least 2013 up until 2015. He allegedly registered a company in Latvia which bore the same name as an Asian-based computer hardware manufacturer and opened various accounts in its name at several banks. \'Fake email accounts\' The DoJ said: \"Thereafter, fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multimillion-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company.\"The emails, which \"purported\" to be from employees and agents of the Asian firm, and were sent from fake email accounts, directed money for legitimate goods and services into Mr Rimasauskas\'s accounts, the DoJ said. The cash was then \"wired into different bank accounts\" in locations around the world - including Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary and Hong Kong. He also \"forged invoices, contracts and letters\" to hide his fraud from the banks he used. Officials said Mr Rimasauskas siphoned off more than $100m in total, although much of the stolen money has been recovered. Acting US Attorney Joon H Kim said: \"This case should serve as a wake-up call to all companies... that they too can be victims of phishing attacks by cybercriminals. \"And this arrest should serve as a warning to all cybercriminals that we will work to track them down, wherever they are, to hold them accountable.\"The DoJ would not comment on possible extradition arrangements and said that no trial date had been set.',tech
'Michael Conlan impresses on professional debut Belfast boxer Michael Conlan made an impressive professional debut as he stopped Tim Ibarra inside three rounds at Madison Square Garden. The super-bantamweight forced referee Benjy Esteves Jr to step in when a powerful right hand had his American opponent on the ropes. Conlan had been joined on his walk to the ring by UFC fighter Conor McGregor. More than 5, 000 Irish fans were at the famous New York venue to cheer on the highly-rated 25-year-old. Conlan, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics, was moving on from the disappointment of failing to win a medal at last year\'s Rio Games where he by some poor scoring. After his dream debut in the paid ranks, Conlan was clearly delighted with the show he put on.\"There was pressure and the thing I was most worried about was my performance,\" said the former world amateur champion.\"At times it showed because I was a bit reckless and was not timing my shots. I was just looking for the knockout.\"I am grateful to all the fans who travelled here. I have never experienced anything like that atmosphere in my life.\"To have that on my debut - I do not think it will ever be beaten.\" ',sport
'The growth in unusual business qualifications Steve Gibson says he has made it clear that people should never approach him for any betting advice.\"I\'m a terrible punter!\" he insists. The 36-year-old does, however, often get asked for tips because of the university course he is enrolled on - an MBA (Master of Business Administration) in thoroughbred horseracing industries. Launched in 2015, the two-year course at Liverpool University has been specially designed for people who want to take up a senior administrative or leadership role in the sport. A sister MBA at the college is called football industries. While the two courses sound like a most enjoyable way to spend your time at university, they are in fact part of a growing trend - the rise of specialised MBAs. MBAs have long been considered a must-have for ambitious young people seeking a fast-tracked and successful career in business. The celebrated post-graduate qualification is supposed to teach you all you need to be a future company leader, and places on MBA courses at the world\'s most prestigious universities are highly sought after, and therefore very difficult to get accepted on. Yet while it used to be the case that having a standard MBA was all you needed, such has been the rise in the number of colleges offering them, and people gaining the qualification, that specialised MBAs are now being increasingly offered with the aim of giving people an advantage in the industry they wish to join.\"Specialisation gives universities and students a way to stand out,\" says Anke Arnaud, associate professor of management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautics University in Florida.\"If everyone is offering an MBA programme, you have to find a way to differentiate, to innovate.\"It starts with attracting lecturers who have a depth of knowledge, and courses that are hip, in the now, and sexy.\"There\'s a need to offer something different to cater to specific careers.\"Field trips At Liverpool University the horseracing MBA includes the study of marketing, sponsorship, the media, sports law, regulation, and horse welfare, explains the head of the course, Neil Coster. Students also go on a number of field trips, including seeing behind the scenes at a race day at Haydock Park, near Liverpool, and a visit to the UK\'s National Stud in Newmarket, in the east of England, the country\'s centre of racehorse breeding. The idea for the course came from industry bodies the British Horseracing Authority and the Horseracing Betting Levy Board. Mr Coster says: \"They saw a need for a master\'s level education programme that would assist people already working in the industry to prepare and upskill for senior management positions, and help career changers to facilitate a move into the industry.\" Those enrolled on the football MBA at Liverpool get to visit the headquarters of European football governing body Uefa, which is based in the Swiss town of Nyon. And if that wasn\'t prestigious enough, last year they also visited nearby Tranmere Rovers. Liverpool\'s football MBA is in fact one of the oldest specialised versions of the qualification, and is now in its 20th year. \"There was clearly a need for graduates with an excellent knowledge of management disciplines and their applications to football,\" says Babatunde Buraimo, a senior lecturer on the course. The football MBA takes one year to complete full time, and costs £15, 000 for UK nationals, or £21, 500 for overseas students. The horseracing qualification costs from £7, 500 per annum for two years.\'Missing link\' Marie-Pierre Serret says she knows all about the value of a specialised MBA because without one she had struggled to secure a fulfilling job in the aviation industry. Despite having a masters degree in international business and marketing, the 43-year-old Frenchwoman says she spent a number of years being bumped from job to job, including working as a flight attendant and a check-in clerk. So a few years ago she sold her house and enrolled on an MBA in aviation management at Florida\'s Embry-Riddle Aeronautics University. It wasn\'t cheap, costing £33, 000 for the course, which takes between one-and-a-half and two years.\"This specialised MBA is the missing link,\" says Ms Serret, who now works as a research assistant for an Embry-Riddle aviation business professor. Projects she has been involved in include working out the marketability of an aeroplane prototype, and advising the Puerto Rican government. Some 1, 200 miles (2, 000km) north of Florida, Schulich Business School in Toronto, Canada, offers a 16-month MBA in global mining. Marcia Annisette, associate professor of accounting at Schulich, says: \"A cookie cutter MBA is so popular now that there\'s a push to have a strong subset of skills.\"Despite the rising popularity of specialist MBAs, they do have their critics, who argue that as so much time is dedicated to focusing on the specific industry, not enough hours are dedicated to teaching business fundamentals. \"With only so much classroom time, taking a focused MBA would lead one to miss valuable lessons,\" says John Paul Engel, lecturer of entrepreneurship at the University of Iowa. Meanwhile, Michal Strahilevitz, marketing professor at Duke University in North Carolina, cautions that she has seen scores of individuals who have pursued specialisation only to then discover that the specific profession wasn\'t quite for them. Others warn that holders of specialised MBAs may struggle to secure the really senior jobs because the qualifications don\'t yet have the kudos of a general MBA. Marlena Corcoran, chief executive of Athena Mentor, an international university admission counselling company, says: \"A person with a specialised MBA is likely to wind up working for a person with a [general] MBA.\"',business
'Downton Abbey\'s Jessica Brown Findlay opens up about eating disorder Downton Abbey\'s Jessica Brown Findlay has spoken about her struggles with body image, revealing that she\'s had an eating disorder since the age of 14.

'Brexit rebel Lord Heseltine sacked from government role Former Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine has been sacked as a government adviser after rebelling over Brexit in the House of Lords. Lord Heseltine backed the demand for a parliamentary vote on the final deal to be written into Brexit legislation. He learned hours later on Tuesday that he had been fired from five government advisory roles he had held. He said he accepted Number 10\'s right to sack him but \"sometimes there are issues which transcend party politics\". Asked what he thought his sacking said about the current government, he told BBC Radio 4\'s Today: \"I have never met Theresa May so I can\'t make a judgement. She\'s doing very well in the polls... the public approve of what she\'s doing.\" Lord Heseltine, who campaigned to remain in the EU, told the Lords that the UK was facing \"the most momentous peacetime decision of our time\". The peer said he was having dinner with his wife when he got a call from the chief whip, and went to the Lords to be told he was being sacked. Lord Heseltine told the BBC the prime minister was \"exercising her perfectly legitimate right to get rid of opposition in any way she finds appropriate\". \"Whether it\'s a wise thing to do is a matter for her not for me,\" he said.\"I have been hugely proud of the work I have done for David Cameron and now for this prime minister, and if they don\'t want me to go on they must sack me.\"He said it was a \"great disappointment\" for him as \"for six years I have had the incredible privilege of working inside the Whitehall machine with civil servants helping ministers to make decisions\". Lord Heseltine continued: \"I did write a newspaper article the other day setting out exactly what I intended to do so I think they could have told me this would be the price, but let me make it quite clear; I would still have voted as I did tonight.\"Sometimes in politics there are issues which transcend party politics; in the end you have to be your own person. I believe our interests are intertwined with Europe. I am not prepared to change. \"Every Conservative prime minister I worked for has told me, including this prime minister before the referendum, that we were essentially seeking British self-interest in Europe.\"It\'s not perfect but it\'s much better than anything that happened before the Second World War.\"The 83-year-old - who dramatically walked out of Mrs Thatcher\'s cabinet during a row over Westland helicopters in 1986 - served as a minister in both her and John Major\'s Conservative governments in the 1980s and 1990s. Nicknamed \"Tarzan\" because of his combative manner and long blond hair, renowned by the press as a Conservative \"big beast\", Michael Heseltine has been a major figure on the UK political scene for decades. Having made a fortune in publishing, he was an MP from 1966 to 2001. After Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, the ambitious and politically centrist Heseltine became environment secretary and then defence secretary. But he and his boss had a huge fall-out in 1986, over a complex dispute involving the future of Westland helicopters. He quit and walked out in the middle of a cabinet meeting. Heseltine remained on the backbenches until, in 1990, with Thatcher apparently losing popularity among the public and her own party, he launched a leadership bid. He didn\'t win but inflicted enough of a blow on the PM\'s prestige for her to resign. John Major won the next contest, but Heseltine, an ardent Europhile, returned to the cabinet, rising to deputy prime minister in the last two years of Major\'s premiership, a period beset with Conservative disputes over the UK\'s relationship with the EU. Heseltine retired as an MP and entered the Lords, where he continued occasionally to speak out on issues dear to his heart - including putting the Remain case during the EU referendum campaign - and also returned to publishing. Lord Heseltine was brought in by former Prime Minister David Cameron to advise the government on a range of projects, including schemes in east London and Swansea. He told Today that his roles were taking up three to four days a week. A Downing Street spokesman said he understood Mrs May had in fact met Lord Heseltine, although he did not confirm whether this was before or after she became prime minister. In a statement, the government said it had \"a clearly stated and consistent position\" that the Brexit bill should be passed without amendment. The chief whip in the Lords asked Lord Heseltine to stand down because he voted against the government\'s official position, it said, adding: \"The government would like to warmly thank Lord Heseltine for his service.\"Former Tory chief whip Mark Harper said it was \"quite reasonable\" to sack Lord Heseltine for opposing government policy. Lord Heseltine\'s recent government roles Economic adviser to Number 10 Adviser to the secretary of state for communities and local growth Adviser on plans on Swansea\'s city deal National infrastructure commissioner Chairman of Estate Regeneration Advisory Panel Chairman of Tees Valley Inward Investment Initiative Brexit Secretary David Davis has said some in the Lords are seeking to \"frustrate\" Brexit but it was the government\'s intention to ensure that did not happen. When the bill returns to the Commons next week ministers will have some persuading to do to reverse the Lords changes, but Theresa May remains on course to trigger Article 50 and begin Brexit negotiations before the end of this month. Peers voted by 366 votes to 268 in favour of an amendment to the bill to have a \"meaningful\" parliamentary vote on the final terms of the Brexit deal. It was the second defeat for the bill in the Lords - the previous one was on the issue of guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens. After a three-hour debate on Tuesday, the turnout for the vote was the largest in the Lords since 1831, according to Parliament\'s website. As well as Lord Heseltine, 12 other Tory peers defied the government to vote in favour of the amendment, including former ministers Lord Deben and Viscount Hailsham. Mrs May has said she wants to trigger Article 50 by the end of March but the Commons is unlikely to have an opportunity to consider the changes made by the Lords until the middle of next week because four days have been set aside for debate on the Budget.

'US charges Russian spies over Yahoo breach Two Russian spies are among four individuals indicted by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) over a huge theft of Yahoo user accounts. The members of the FSB, the Russian intelligence agency, conspired with criminal hackers, according to DOJ officials announcing the charges. Previously, Yahoo said \"state-sponsored\" hackers were behind the 2014 breach affecting 500 million accounts. The suspects are also alleged to have targeted Google accounts. Hacking was directed at Russian and US government officials, including security, diplomatic and military personnel, according to the DOJ. The indictment also alleged that 30 million Yahoo accounts were commandeered without authorisation for use in a spam campaign. FBI \'most wanted\' \"We will not allow individuals, groups, nation states, or a combination of them to compromise the privacy of our citizens, the economic interests of our companies, or the security of our country,\" said acting attorney general Mary McCord, announcing the charges. The suspects were named in as: Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev, 33, a Russian national and FSB officer Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin, 43, a Russian national and FSB officer Alexsey Alexseyevich Belan, 29, a Russian national and resident Karim Baratov, 22, a Canadian and Kazakh national and a resident of Canada Baratov was arrested on 14 March in Canada. One of the alleged hackers has been on of the FBI\'s most wanted cyber criminals for more than three years, according to acting Att Gen McCord. The suspect in question, Alexsey Belan, was aided by the FSB who - according to the DOJ - provided him with \"sensitive FSB law enforcement and intelligence information that would have helped him avoid detection by US and other law enforcement agencies outside Russia\".\"We would hope [Russia] would respect our criminal justice system and respect these charges,\" said acting Att Gen McCord, acknowledging the fact that the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia.\"The United Kingdom\'s MI5 made substantial contributions to the advancement of this investigation,\" added FBI executive assistant director Paul Abbate. Personal data stolen Yahoo was criticised for the delay in informing users about the 2014 breach. The stolen data included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords, but not credit card data, according to Yahoo. Last year, users were advised to change their passwords. Around eight million UK accounts were believed to have been affected - including some users of BT and Sky email services.\"The indictment unequivocally shows the attacks on Yahoo were state-sponsored,\" Yahoo said , responding to the DOJ announcement.\"We are deeply grateful to the FBI for investigating these crimes and the DOJ for bringing charges against those responsible.\"The DOJ said that the charges have no connection to the hack on the Democratic National Convention last year.',tech
'Mark Warburton: Nottingham Forest \'risk\' is worth taking Mark Warburton says the stature of Nottingham Forest and the potential at the club means becoming the 26th man to take charge since Brian Clough left in 1993 is a risk worth taking. The ex-Rangers manager is the 10th appointment made by owner Fawaz Al Hasawi in less than five years. Forest are just two points clear of the Championship relegation zone. \"The size, quality, expectation and tradition of the club must excite you,\" Warburton told BBC Nottingham Sport.\"I know there is a job to be done but there is no doubt about the potential here. Our job is to add some stability.\"Warburton, 54, who has been out of work since insisted he was \"comfortable\" with the assurances he has been given by the owners at the City Ground despite the ongoing upheaval. Al Hasawi has but Warburton said he was not put off by the uncertainty and owner\'s reputation for sacking managers.\"You take everything into consideration,\" he added. \"It\'s a pleasure and privilege to be here.\"You have to take risks; you can\'t always play safe - far from it. I\'m confident we are moving forward and we have the support from the board we need to have.\"Keeping Brazil and Lester on the map Warburton is eager to see Gary Brazil, who had remain at the club. Academy director Brazil and academy coach Jack Lester have both mulling over offers to revert to their roles with the youth set-up, which has seen players like Ben Brereton, Matty Cash, Ben Osborn, Joe Worrall and Oliver Burke progress into the first team. Warburton met Brazil and Lester on Thursday morning and was \"hopeful\" they would stay on.\"They have done tremendous work in the academy,\" Warburton added. \"Academies exist to get players into the first-team squad and you look at the first-team squad and they have done a very good job. There is no doubt about that.\"They stepped into a difficult role and I am full of respect for the work they did. \"I had a good chat with them this morning after meeting them for the first time. I look forward to them hopefully continuing the work in the academy. I was delighted with the chat. The quality of the work was there for all to see.\"Talking Frankly The future of Brazil and Lester will be handled by Forest\'s new director of football Frank McParland, who Mark Warburton has worked with at both Brentford and RangersWarburton was thrilled to have a familiar face in such an \"important\" role.\"I have known Frank very well over a number of years,\" Warburton said. \"I have watched him work, have watched the quality of his work, the quality of his recruitment, his eye for a player and his knowledge of football clubs so I am full of respect for him.\"He is an outstanding individual - one of the best in the business. \"Frank coming in early gave us a real insight into where the club was, the players and the staff. That really helped us. It was a very swift decision, but was helped by the fact Frank was here first.\" All change for derby day Forest are 19th in the Championship, having lost five of their past seven matches, and face fierce local rivals Derby County at home on Saturday. The Rams also have a new manager in charge, meaning it will be the fifth consecutive East Midlands derby with a different manager in charge of both clubs. Warburton said: \"These are the games players must relish and understand the emotions and passion that is involved. We know exactly what it means to supporters. It is a huge game for a number of reasons. \"I understand the significance of this game, what it means to people in the area. It is important for the players to get the balance right. \"You have to go out and perform and enjoy the pressure. But they must understand what the game means to people.\"Staying up and targeting the top flight Warburton said his immediate priority was ensuring survival in the second tier of English football. But he is already thinking further afield.\"We have to get the club back to where it needs to be in the short, medium and long term,\" he said. \"We need to stay in the division. We have to steady the ship, get the performances in and the points we require on the board then then we need a solid pre-season to try to fine-tune the squad and add quality in key areas.\"The Premier League is the promised land and that is where we have to get to. A club of this stature has to be in the Premier League. That has to be a very clear and realistic ambition.\" How will Warburton make his mark? Warburton brings a very specific ethos about football and how it should be played. To some extent that was welcomed at Rangers especially as he won the Championship in his first season - the second tier in Scotland. He won that at a canter playing some very attractive football. Rangers played this short passing game and scored a lot of goals. It was very effective and he made a lot of good signings at that level and they were promoted without any fuss whatsoever. The downside of that particular brand of football was that Warburton always said Plan B for me is to do Plan A better. What happened then was when their opponents began to learn how to combat that style of play he wouldn\'t then knock it long and try a more direct style, which is commendable in some respects. Stubborn or principled and stylish? Mark Warburton wouldn\'t compromise his ethos but ultimately that began to cost him results, especially when he moved up to the the Premiership when they were were coming up against better teams and better organised defences and Rangers found it much more difficult to score this season. I guess that is one of the factors that ultimately cost him his job. The players will, by and large, buy into what he is trying to achieve because it is an exciting brand of football he wants to play and is pleasant on the eyeUltimately it will come down to results and can he keep Nottingham Forest up? It did seem initially he was on to a good thing and Rangers fans really bought into what he was trying to achieve. But things turned sour and some fans turned things like always making substitutions on the hour mark. He has his own way of doing things and will not relish being moved away from that.',sport
'South Korea\'s powerful Lotte family goes on trial Four members of the powerful family behind the $81bn (£66bn) Lotte Group business empire have gone on trial in Seoul this week. Monday\'s session was a rare reunion of Lotte\'s 94-year-old founder Shin Kyuk-ho and his three oldest children. His two sons fought a public battle over control of the company, while his daughter is currently in prison. The four were on a range of charges including embezzlement, tax evasion and fraud. The trial is significant because South Korea\'s family-controlled conglomerates, or \"chaebols\", used to be considered untouchable given they have powered much of the country\'s economic growth. But in recent years, the chaebols and their family members have become the focus of public anger over inequality and corruption. The corruption trial is separate from the investigation facing over her alleged dealings with other big conglomerates, including the Samsung Group. The first day of the Lotte trial was a dramatic one. Here is the background. Founding father In a packed courtroom on Monday, nonagenarian patriarch Shin Kyuk-ho showed his displeasure at being called to court. \"Lotte is a company that I made, I have 100\% of the shares, who indicted me?\" the 94-year-old reportedly shouted before throwing his cane on the floor. The judge had to ask the Lotte Group founder to be quiet. Mr Shin is said to suffer from dementia, according to a citing his eldest son. News agencies said he appeared confused as he entered court in a wheelchair. Mr Shin ceded control of the Lotte business empire, which spans hotels to department stores, after being ousted by his younger son in 2015. Shin Kyuk-ho has been indicted for tax evasion, embezzlement and breach of trust, but his lawyer said he denied all charges. The eldest son The Shin family first came under investigation after a feud between Shin Dong-Joo, 63, and his younger brother erupted into public view. Shin Dong-Joo, the eldest son of Lotte\'s founder, had been considered the heir apparent but was usurped by his younger brother who had successfully expanded the brand. He subsequently attempted a failed boardroom coup last year. The bitter battle between the two brothers triggered investigations into the Lotte Group, which led to 22 people - including the four family members - being indicted by prosecutors. The chairman Younger son and Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin, 62, is accused of embezzlement and breach of fiduciary duty. This includes alleged tax evasion, financial scams and irregular payments to family members. His lawyer said the payments in question were organised by his father without Shin Dong-bin\'s involvement, according to Reuters. The Lotte Group has said most of the allegations aren\'t directly linked to him as they involve events during the time his father was in charge. The jailed sister Shin Young-ja has been sitting behind bars since last July. She was sentenced to three years in jail in January for embezzlement and breach of trust. Formerly the head of Lotte Shopping, Shin Young-ja has resigned from both the company and her other board posts. A firm in crisis? Lotte, which is South Korea\'s fifth-biggest conglomerate, isn\'t just facing a tough time in court. Around 80\% of its stores have been shut in China as part of the backlash against a US missile defence system being deployed in South Korea. The firm had provided land to host the Terminal High Altitude Defense (Thaad) system, which the US and South Korea say is aimed at protecting against threats from North Korea. However the move has angered China, which says the system can be use to spy on it, and led to a series of economic reprisals. Lotte Group has more than 90 firms in sectors as diverse as beer, hotels, theme parks and chemicals. Since the financial scandal became public, it has already led to the firm pulling out of a share sale worth as much as $4. 5bn for its hotel unit. The scandal has also been linked to the of one of the company\'s top executives. In August, then Vice Chairman Lee In-won was found dead hours before he was to be questioned in the corruption probe.',business

Hammond thanked fans on Monday for their concern and said there was no lasting damage.\'I banged my head\' he said: \"It\'s true, I did fall off a motorbike whilst filming recently for The Grand Tour in Mozambique. \"I banged my head, yes, along with pretty much everything else apart from my left thumb, which remains un-bruised. \"Can\'t tell you more yet about the how and why of it; that\'s all for later in the year on the show. \"As for injuries; well put it this way, I don\'t think I can get a book out of it.\"\'Slight shunt\' In an earlier post, he said \"I\'m fine\" and described the accident as a \"slight shunt\", adding that he \"fell off a bike, many times\".

'MPs may face new rules on second jobs Parliament\'s ethics watchdog is to review its guidance on MPs\' second jobs in the wake of George Osborne\'s appointment as the editor of the London Evening Standard. The Committee on Standards in Public Life insisted the move had not been solely prompted by the ex-chancellor. Mr Osborne has faced calls to quit as an MP over his outside interests, which also include a role at a bank. The Standards Committee was set up in 1995 following corruption scandals. It does not have the power to block individual MPs from taking extra jobs - but it could change their code of conduct on outside interests. The Commons standards committee is separately looking at a possible crackdown on MPs working while the Commons is sitting, which could scupper Mr Osborne\'s latest career move. And a third committee is investigating whether Mr Osborne\'s new role is a conflict of interest with his former job as chancellor. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACOB) - can advise former ministers not to take up new jobs for up to two years if it deems them to be a reward or favour - but it has no formal powers to block appointments., while advising him not to use insider knowledge and contacts gained at the Treasury. Osborne\'s jobs MP for Tatton: Paid £74, 962 a year Editor, London Evening Standard: Paid £200, 000, according to reports Adviser, BlackRock Investment Institute: Paid £650, 000 a year Chair, Northern Powerhouse Partnership: Unpaid Kissinger Fellow at the McCain Institute: £120, 212 stipend to cover travel and research costs Washington Speaker\'s Bureau: Paid nearly £800, 000 for engagements since July Mr Osborne shocked the media and political worlds when he announced he would be working four days a week as editor of the London newspaper - despite a lack of journalistic experience - at the same time as being MP for Tatton, in Cheshire. He has argued that it is important for the Commons to include people with \"different experiences\". He is far from the only MP to have outside interests - more than 100 MPs do other work apart from representing their constituents, from occasional TV appearances and speeches to running a farm or working as a doctor, dentist, company director or lawyer. Standards in Public Life committee chairman Lord Bew said he had been considering reviewing what the Code of Conduct for MPs should say about second jobs for some time.

Second jobs are currently deemed \"OK\" by the committee if voters know about them \"at the moment of the election,\" he said. The committee\'s longstanding position was that it was \"not entirely desirable\" to have a class of professional politicians with no experience of other occupations, said the peer. But he added: \"It is clear that the public\'s attitude has shifted on this matter and is more negative about it, although I can tell you from the letters we receive that the public is still divided on this issue.\"',politics
'Controller issues with Nintendo Switch Nintendo is facing more complaints about its new console, Switch, this time about the controllers failing to connect. The company said it was looking into the matter, which could be caused by wireless interference, and suggested gamers sat closer to the console. It comes after some players complained about their screens containing dead pixels that created black squares. The console has received largely positive reviews and is selling well. Reports about problems with the controllers, known as Joy-Con, have been around since before the launch of the console, among those who had pre-release review units. It seems to affect play when the console is connected to the TV and the controllers are being used wirelessly., Nintendo advised users to make sure that the Switch console was placed \"out in the open\" and not behind a TV, in or under a metal object or near an aquarium. It also advised users to make sure the console had the latest software update and to \"try to decrease the distance\" between the Joy-Con and the console. The problem seems to be worse in the left-hand controller and some, including games writer Jeff Gerstmann, report it is affected by how close users sit to the TV. A video posted on YouTube suggested that while the right-hand Joy-Con had a dedicated antenna, the left-hand one was harder to find.\"The antenna is printed directly on the controller\'s circuit board; it\'s not a separate unit inside the device. Second, the antenna is located beneath the controller\'s shoulder button and next to the housing for the controller\'s joystick,\" \"All of that could block or weaken the Bluetooth signal,\" it added. on the social media platform Reddit suggested that 20\% of respondents (out of a total of 6, 300) had experienced some kind of issue with their Switch console. Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst at research firm IHS Markit said: \"Obviously, if this does occur when gaming it can be frustrating, but generally I don\'t think this is impacting people\'s enjoyment of the platform too heavily.\"\"What is perhaps making it worse is that the right Joy-Con has better connectivity which is highlighting the left\'s relative weakness. \"If this is a design issue, I expect Nintendo to look closely at adjusting the lay-out of the antenna in the left Joy-Con to help solve the issue, as the fix would appear relatively straightforward.\"',tech
'Luther Burrell: \'Dynamic\' Northampton Saints ready for Leicester Tigers clash Northampton Saints centre Luther Burrell says they will be in \"right in the mix\" for a top-four finish if they can beat Leicester Tigers on Saturday. Saints are sixth in the Premiership, four points behind fourth-placed Bath. England international Burrell, 29, is available to make his comeback after eight weeks out injured. \"The contacts are a little bit more physical because everyone is getting themselves mentally into the place they need to be to compete,\" he said. Saints, who missed out on last season\'s play-offs, finishing fifth in the table, five points adrift of Leicester. will also be boosted by the return of members of England\'s Six Nations title-winning squad. \"We are in a position where if we put in a good performance this weekend we are right back in the mix,\" Burrell told BBC Radio Northampton.\"We can\'t get ahead of ourselves. The story of our season has been like a rollercoaster but we\'ve got our internationals back, they\'ve added a bit of edge in training this week.\"Team-mate Kieran Brookes will again be facing the club where he spent two years of his career.\"It is a last big push,\" the prop said. \"Potentially we can still get in to the top four if we get wins and results go our way.\" ',sport
'Oil nations look at extending supply cut Major oil producers are considering extending their recent cuts to output in a fresh bid to boost prices. Countries in the oil cartel Opec and several other oil nations started to reduce production at the start of 2017. The move initially pushed up the oil price, but it has dropped in the last few weeks on fears the limits would not be enough to deal with an oil glut. A group of ministers to review extending the cuts by six months, taking them to the end of 2017. At a meeting in Kuwait, they requested that officials report next month \"regarding the extension of the voluntary production adjustments\". Opec countries and 11 other oil-producing nations, including Russia, agreed in December 2016 to slash production, the first time in 15 years that a global pact had been struck.\'Jittery\' The price of Brent crude peaked at over $57 a barrel in January, before slipping back to below $51 a barrel in recent weeks. That was after Opec in global crude stocks in February, and US oil producers - who are not part of the cuts - started to increase production again. Abhishek Deshpande, an oil analyst at Natixis, told the BBC the price had fallen after oil traders became \"jittery\" about the market. In particular, they were uncertain about the commitment of Russia and Saudi Arabia, Opec\'s biggest member, to the cuts, Mr Deshpande said. The oil countries now need to show \"discipline\" and cut back on production in the coming months because stocks are still too high, he said.\"The chances remain high for an extension to the supply cuts, as long as there are more stockpile withdrawals,\" he added. What and who is Opec? Formed in 1960, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) coordinates the energy policies of member countries, who produce about a third of the world\'s oil Its members include Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Venezuela A number of other major oil-producing nations such as the US and Russia are not Opec members ',business

'Fathers \'afraid to ask for flexible working\' Dads who want to be more involved in the care of their children fear that asking for more flexible hours might damage their careers, the chairwoman of a new probe into the issue says. Conservative MP Maria Miller says such requests can even lead to employers questioning their workers\' commitment. Research suggests 44\% of dads have lied about family-related responsibilities. The Women and Equalities Committee inquiry aims to find out how much support fathers receive at work. On Wednesday, the committee began taking evidence to try to uncover what demand there is for change. MPs will look at how well fathers feel their current working arrangements help them to fulfil caring responsibilities for children of all ages - and if they have the financial support to carry these out. The inquiry comes in the wake of the , authored by employment campaign group Working Families, which suggested that while family was the highest priority for fathers, half of those interviewed felt their work-life balance was increasingly a source of stress. It will also consider: whether an increase in freelance, agency or casual working might have an impact on fathers whether workplace attitudes about fatherhood need to be challenged if so, what role government, employers and other stakeholders can play in overcoming them Sarah Jackson, chief executive officer of Working Families, gave evidence on how current laws on paternity leave could be improved. She told the select committee that paternity leave and shared parental leave should be a \"day one\" right for all fathers. \"At the moment you have to be an employee, and you also, even as an employee, have to have been employed for 26 weeks - at last 15 weeks before your baby is due - to be able to give notice to take two weeks\' paternity leave.\" \"So there is this huge inequality that fathers face in the workplace, right at the start.\" She also argued that flexible working laws needed to be looked at. \"Hardly any flexible working cases ever get to tribunal. There are two reasons for that. One, is that the tribunals can only look at the process, has the employer followed the proper process; they can\'t look at whether there is really a business case for refusal. \"The other thing is that the remedies are so low. The maximum remedy is 8 weeks\' pay, so if you are a low-paid father, you are not going to gamble your job on 8 weeks\' pay, and if you are an employer who doesn\'t really want to have to think about this, 8 weeks\' pay is not much of a penalty to worry about.\" However, she did not feel that making paternity a protected characteristic, which would make it illegal for companies to discriminate against men for being fathers, would work. She said: \"What I would be much more interested in talking about is some sort of protected characteristic that is about having care responsibilities. \"Because that would capture men, women, same sex couples, adopters, people caring for disabled children, people caring for elderly parents, people caring for terminally ill spouses. There are so many people who are not covered by discrimination law as it currently exists, and we could do so much better.\" \'Culture change needed\' Tina Miller, Professor of Sociology at Oxford Brookes University, noted that while the introduction of Shared Parental Leave was an important signal of a commitment to change, it was simply not the case that men and women now had an equal choice over who would work in a family. \"It\'s much more complex than that, because people need money when a baby is born, usually because of the motherhood penalty, when the mother doesn\'t earn so much, there are all sorts of financial reasons it makes sense for the father to stay in work.\"The government forecasts that between 2\% and 8\% of eligible fathers will take up Shared Parental Leave, a flagship policy introduced in 2015. Maria Miller said: \"Many fathers want to be just as involved in their children\'s lives as mothers do, which is good for children too.\"But she said there were \"significant questions about whether culture at work has changed enough\" to enable the shared leave policy to be effective. And she added: \"We need to find out what we can learn from other countries.\"Sarah Jackson and Professor Tina Miller were joined in giving evidence by the Centre for Social Justice\'s Edward Davies and Family Initiative\'s Duncan Fisher. Working fathers will also be detailing their experiences during sessions after Easter.',politics
'Tech Tent: Fake ads, fake news and real voice tech the latest Tech Tent episode on the BBC website the latest episode as a podcast Listen to on the BBC website Listen live every Friday at 15. 00 GMT on the BBC World Service Fake advertising The tidal wave of fake news spreading across the web has brought mounting pressure on Google and Facebook to face up to their responsibilities as platforms for false information. But now the two web giants are under pressure over another kind of fakery - fake advertising. On this week\'s Tech Tent we hear about the advertising industry\'s mounting anger over a problem that is damaging its credibility with its clients. When advertising began to move online, there was the promise of much better targeting and much more accurate measurement of how well a marketing message performed. Instead all sorts of issues, from bots that generate phony views of ads to the placing of advertisements next to unsuitable content, have shaken confidence in the industry. A media industry conference in London this week heard a prediction that out of $80bn (£65bn) of digital ad spending in 2017, over $16bn would be eaten up by fraud. Johnny Hornby, founder of a media agency called The&amp; Partnership, tells Tech Tent that the time has come for a radical response. He says a tool called pre-bid verification, which checks sites to make sure they are not fraudulent and allows agencies to make sure they are not placing ads where they will generate phony clicks, has been shown to wipe out most fraud. But he says both Google and Facebook have refused to let this software on their platforms. Hornby is calling for the industry to unite and threaten a boycott if the two web giants, which account for two-thirds of online advertising, don\'t shape up. Google told us it did not allow third-party software on to its services but argued that it was a leader in combating ad fraud: \"Last year, we took down almost seven million bad ads for intentionally attempting to trick our detection systems,\" a spokesman said. Of course, its online advertising and the revenue it can produce is also driving the creation of fake news sites. But the digital media commentator Prof Jeff Jarvis tells us that journalists must share the blame with the likes of Google and Facebook for this phenomenon. Indeed he thinks the old media, which treated its audience as one giant indistinguishable mass, can learn from the web giants how to relate to people on an individual level. But he does believe the platforms have a duty to show their users more about the sources of information and to try to understand how they are being manipulated. Driverless cars Two other big tech trends on this week\'s programme - driverless cars and speech recognition. Prof Paul Newman is the founder of Oxbotica, which is creating operating systems for autonomous vehicles. He talks to us about the contrast between the rapid advance in the technology behind driverless cars and the slow progress of the infrastructure - physical, social, and legal - which will be needed to support them. And then we talk about how quickly we\'ve moved in getting machines to understand the human voice, with Dan Faulkner of Nuance, a company that has been a pioneer in speech recognition. He tells us that now machines can understand what we say and respond to our instructions, it\'s time to move to the next stage - \"enabling machines to actually drive a conversation and take it in a direction which makes sense to them\". In other words, one day soon your smartphone could start asking you questions or perhaps giving you instructions. Are you ready for Siri or Alexa to tell you to empty the dishwasher and put the dinner on? I\'m not sure I am…',tech
'Alistair Brownlee: \'I may not compete at Olympics again\' Double Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee says he may not return to triathlon for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The World Triathlon Series starts in Abu Dhabi on Friday but Brownlee, 28, is not racing as he The Yorkshireman defending \"There\'s a chance I could never be at an Olympic Games again but to say I\'ll never do it is impossible,\" he said.\"The Olympic Games are just fantastic and I\'d definitely love to be there but the course in Tokyo is going to play a big part in terms of whether I feel I can go there and win.\"It\'s going to be a case of sitting down at the end of 2018 and weighing it up - am I enjoying the long distance stuff? Am I still able to be competitive enough to win a medal in Tokyo?\"Brownlee will once again look to win the Leeds leg of the World Series on 11 June, but that is his only confirmed race so far this season, while brother and Rio silver medallist Jonny begins his campaign from the second race in the Gold Coast on 8 April. For the rest of the year, Alistair Brownlee will combine standard Olympic length events - 1. 5km swim, 40km on the bike and 10km run - with half Ironman distance competitions, also referred to as Ironman 70. 3 in reference to the total number of miles covered. He added that the Ironman 70. 3 World Championship in September is an \"obvious\" target as he builds up to the full Ironman distance, which he says has always been on his \"bucket list\".\"Ironman has got to be one of those things you always want to do - it\'s like the London or Boston marathon of triathlon,\" he added. No Gomez, no glory? The two-time gold medallist added that his Rio 2016 win was slightly marred by the absence of long-term rival and London 2012 silver medallist Javier Gomez, who withdrew from the Games after \"It definitely took a bit away from my gold in Rio that Gomez wasn\'t there,\" said Brownlee.\"You want to be there in your best shape and race the best athletes in their best shape - we were fortunate to have that in London and it would have been fantastic to have had that in Rio as well but what happened happened.\"But on that day, on that course, I\'m fairly confident I\'d have had him anyway.\"With Gomez, 33, back from that injury, Brownlee expects the Spaniard to challenge for the World Series title, alongside compatriot and current champion Mario Mola, 27. And the older Brownlee expects Jonny, 26, to complete the podium and says his brother could claim the title with \"a bit of luck and a fair wind behind him\". Marathons and cycling next? Alistair Brownlee says he may have been \"bored\" returning to World Series racing, having experienced the \"same kind of racing against basically the same people for the last 10 years\". However, he adds that he is motivated by his new goals, which could include competing in 10, 000m running races and the marathon.\"I now have an opportunity to try these other things without hurting my chances if I do decide I want to compete in four years in Tokyo,\" he said.\"I thought about a lot of things after Rio. I definitely want to run a marathon and that might be in the not too distant future.\"The other obvious thing is cycling and trying to make a wholehearted jump into being a professional cyclist but although that\'s possible, I\'m very aware that in that arena and in running, I can be good and get to a level where I could be professional, but never to a level where I can win stuff.\"I still feel like I want to be the best at what I\'m doing so that\'s why I\'m choosing things I feel like I can win.\"',sport
'Ikea drivers living in trucks for months Lorry drivers moving goods in Western Europe for Ikea and other retailers are living out of their cabs for months at a time, a BBC investigation has found. Some drivers - brought over from poorer countries by lorry firms based in Eastern Europe - say their salary is less than three pounds an hour. They say they cannot afford to live in the countries where they work. One said he felt \"like a prisoner\" in his cab. Ikea said it was \"saddened by the testimonies\" of the drivers. The drivers the BBC spoke to were employed by haulage companies based in Eastern Europe, which are paid to transport Ikea goods. \'Road accidents possible\' Romanian driver Emilian spends up to four months at a time sleeping, eating and washing in his truck. He moves goods for Ikea around Western Europe, and had been in Denmark most recently. He says the salary he takes home is a monthly average of 477 euros (£420). A Danish driver can expect to take home an average of 2, 200 euros (£1, 900) a month in salary. EU rules state that a driver posted temporarily away from home should be \'\'guaranteed\'\' the host nation\'s \'\'minimum rates of pay\'\' and conditions. But companies can exploit loopholes in the law. Emilian is employed by a Slovakian subsidiary of Norwegian trucking company Bring, and is being paid as if his place of work is Slovakia - even though he never works there. He shows us where he sleeps - a sleeping bag in the back of his cab. According to EU law, drivers must take 45 hours weekly rest away from their cabs, but governments have been slow to enforce it. He says he cannot afford to sleep anywhere else - he receives around 45 euros (£40) a day in expenses, which is meant to cover all hotel bills and meals. Find out more Zoe Conway was reporting for the BBC\'s and programmes. During the working week, Emilian cooks and eats at the roadside. He says conditions have left him feeling \"like a prisoner, like a bird in the cage\".\"It\'s not good for drivers, it\'s not safe for other people on the road... it is possible to [cause an] accident,\" he says. Asked if he has a message for Ikea, he says: \"Come and live with me for one week. Eat what I eat. See what is happening in reality with our lives.\"After a few months on the road he will board a minibus back to Slovakia. His Slovakian employer, Bring, says Emilian is responsible for taking his rest breaks, and can return home whenever he likes. No toilet or running water Emilian is not alone. We have seen the contracts of drivers working for some of Ikea\'s biggest contractors - each paid low Eastern European wages while working for months at a time in Western Europe. It is clear this way of treating drivers is widespread. It is not just within the Ikea supply chain, but also in those of several other big, household names. In Dortmund, Germany - outside the biggest Ikea distribution centre in the world - truck drivers are drying their clothes. One is making his mash potato on a fuel tank. There is no toilet, no running water. Drivers from Moldova say they receive an average monthly salary of 150 euros (£130) from their employer.\'Inhumane\' Legal action is now being taken against some of Ikea\'s contractors. In the Netherlands last month, a court ruled that Brinkman - which delivers Ikea flowers to the UK and Scandinavia - was breaking the law. The court found that drivers\' pay was \"not consistent\" with Dutch wages law. The judge described conditions for drivers as an \"inhumane state of affairs\'\', and contrary to EU law. Edwin Atema, of trade union FNV, says he believes Ikea must have known of the conditions in which drivers are living.\"The Ukrainian, Moldovan, Polish guys remove the furniture from Ikea, they touch the furniture,\" he says.\"Ikea is the economic employer of all these workers here. They have so much power. Ikea has the tool in hand to change the business model with an eye blink.\"One union, the International Transport Workers\' Federation (ITF), met Ikea several times last year to discuss the issue - but talks ended in November. Ikea said it takes what drivers have told the BBC \"very seriously\'\' and are \"saddened by the testimonies\". It said it puts \'\'strict demands\'\' on its suppliers concerning wages, working conditions and following applicable legislation, and audits them regularly to check compliance. Increasing numbers of foreign haulage companies are now moving goods in Britain. They are working for hundreds of different companies, including Ikea. At a lorry stop in Immingham, Lincolnshire, one anonymous Polish driver explains: \"We spend a lot of time living in lay-bys where there are no toilets, no showers, no facilities. \"The work is paid a bit better than what I would get in Poland, but this life is not good. I do it for my family.\'\'British haulage companies are nervous that they will be undercut by companies that could be breaking the law. Jack Semple, from the Road Haulage Association, says: \"We are seeing far more foreign lorries that are frankly less compliant with drivers\' hours and road-worthiness regulations. \"There is a road safety risk, and the Treasury is losing a fortune in tax revenue.\"They have to get a grip on this because big, well-known UK retailers and other companies are making increasing use of these firms because they don\'t cost very much.\"',business

It was taken on by the Fact arts centre in Liverpool on Wednesday. But it was halted by police on Thursday when people climbed on to the roof to reach a flag that was being streamed. The project has become a target for pro-Trump activists since it began at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York on 20 January - the day of the president\'s inauguration. It was meant to be a live stream of people chanting \"he will not divide us\" for four years - but became the scene of numerous arrests and threats of violence. after three weeks and it moved to Albuquerque and then a secret location in the US, but each time disruption forced it to close.

'Brexit \'clears way\' for German domination claims Heseltine The UK is handing control of Europe\'s destiny to Germany by leaving the EU, Lord Heseltine has claimed. The Tory peer, sacked as a government adviser after defying the whip over Brexit, said the Germans had lost World War Two but the UK was now giving them the \"opportunity to win the peace\". \"I find that quite unacceptable,\" he told UKIP said the comments showed Lord Heseltine was \"utterly out of touch with the modern world\". \"If I was German I would be deeply offended,\" a UKIP spokesman told the BBC. In a wide-ranging interview, Lord Heseltine questioned how Theresa May could campaign to remain in the EU as home secretary but \"within a few weeks\" of becoming PM, insist \"Brexit means Brexit\". The prime minister, he added, had seemed to change her mind on the issue, suggesting \"this lady was for turning\". Lord Heseltine, who was deputy prime minister between 1992 and 1997, said he would continue to argue against the decision to leave the EU, believing it was against the UK\'s historic national interest. \'Disaster\' The 83-year old said he was \"now free\" to speak out after he was relieved of his five economic advisory roles after defying party managers to vote against Brexit in the House of Lords.\"If anyone is listening, I will continue to play a role in trying to avert what I perceive to be a disaster of British self-interest,\" he was quoted as saying. \"The letters keep flowing, the invitations keep coming... They haven\'t kicked me out of the party yet. They kicked me out of my advisory jobs but as yet there is no suggestion I should be asked for my membership card.\"Not only would Brexit alter the balance of power in Europe, he suggested that for many people of his generation, the UK\'s decision might be regarded as a betrayal of the country\'s fight against the Nazis. \"For someone like myself, it was in 1933, the year of my birth, that Hitler was democratically elected in Germany. He unleashed the most horrendous war.\"This country played a unique role in securing his defeat. So Germany lost the war. We have just handed them the opportunity to win the peace.\"\'Shift of focus\' He dismissed those who argue Britain\'s standing in the world would be unaffected by EU withdrawal, saying the UK would lose its ability to act as a bridge between both the Commonwealth and the US and Europe.\"The Americans will shift the focus of their interest to Germany.\"Lord Heseltine has long been one of the most pro-European voices in his party but has rejected the Europhile tag often given to him - saying that EU membership is about enhancing the UK\'s national interest not giving up power and identity. He said he had \"no complaints\" about the way he had been treated by the prime minister, saying they came from a different political generation and had never met, let alone discussed Europe. Snap election But he suggested that she had not shown the iron resolve of her predecessor Lady Thatcher, who the peer served under and later helped to depose as prime minister. Lady Thatcher famously told the 1980 Conservative party conference, at a time of intense calls for the government to reverse its economic policies, \"you turn if you want to, this lady\'s not for turning.\"Pointing to a speech Mrs May made two months before the EU referendum - in which she called for Britain to \"stand tall and lead in Europe\" - Lord Heseltine said: \"I don\'t know how someone who made that speech can, within a few weeks, say Brexit is Brexit and ask the nation to unite behind it... This lady was for turning.\"Lord Heseltine also urged former Chancellor George Osborne not to rule out a return to frontline politics and disclosed that he did not vote for Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith as London Mayor because of Mr Goldsmith\'s pro-Brexit stance. He also advised the prime minister to resist the \"powerful\" temptation to call a snap election, suggesting the result of the Richmond by-election, won by the Lib Dems, showed the \"deep and bitter fury\" of many voters who wanted to remain in the EU.\'Out of date\' Conservative MP David TC Davies said he respected Lord Heseltine and the generation whose world view was shaped by war but their outlook was not shared by others. \"For them the EU was not just a trading arrangement. It was a way of avoiding a third world war,\" he said. \"But it is an analysis that is decades out of date. We can\'t carry on as if we are all still living in the 1950s.\"Mr Davies, who is vice chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on British-German relations, added: \"There is no chance of a war between Germany, France and Britain. We all share the same values and we are all open to each other for trade.\"Responding to Lord Heseltine\'s comments, a UKIP spokesman said: \"What an extraordinary thing to say. Has he lost his marbles?\"I never realised the purpose of Britain\'s membership of the EU was to stop German domination of Europe.\"For someone who is deeply pro-European to basically say he doesn\'t trust the German people not to misbehave shows how utterly out of touch he is with the modern world and the modern, democratic and free Germany.\"',politics
'Facebook data \'off-limits\' for spy tools Facebook data can no longer be used by developers to create surveillance tools, the social network has said. It follows the American Civil Liberties Union of California\'s revelations the police had used surveillance tool Geofeedia to access data from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The ACLU said Facebook had made it \"crystal clear\" such data was now off-limits. It called for swift action when there were any violations of the new rules., Rob Sherman, deputy chief privacy officer at Facebook, said developers could no longer \"use data obtained from us to provide tools that are used for surveillance\". \"We are committed to building a community where people can feel safe making their voices heard,\" he said.\"Our approach involves making careful decisions every day about how we use and protect data at Facebook.\"Democratic dissent Last year, the ACLU of California obtained thousands of pages of public records that revealed some 20 law enforcement agencies in the state had acquired social media spying software, such as Geofeedia, that allowed them to track civil rights activists. The ACLU suggested that \"law enforcement should not be using tools that treat protesters like enemies\", noting that it had found no evidence of \"any public notice, debate, community input or lawmaker vote\" about the use of such software. In November, after the ACLU revelations, Twitter said that using its data to \"track or profile protesters and activists is absolutely unacceptable and prohibited\". In response to Facebook\'s changes, the ACLU of California\'s technology director, Nicole Ozer, said: \"We depend on social networks to connect and communicate about the most important issues in our lives and the core political and social issues in our country.\"Now more than ever, we expect companies to slam shut any surveillance side doors and make sure nobody can use their platforms to target people of colour and activists.\"Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, said: \"When technology companies allow their platforms and devices to be used to conduct mass surveillance of activists and other targeted communities, it chills democratic dissent and gives authoritarianism a licence to thrive. \"It\'s clear there is more work to be done to protect communities of colour from social media spying, censorship and harassment.\"',tech

'What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? Almost a decade ago, . They should have taken the bet - I am still alive. But they will not gamble on life and death. A life insurance company, by contrast, does little else. Legally and culturally, there is a clear distinction between gambling and insurance. Economically the difference is less visible. Both gambler and insurer agree that money will change hands depending on what transpires in some unknowable future. Find out more highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find and or . Gambling tools such as dice date back millennia - perhaps five thousand years in Egypt. Insurance may be equally old. The Code of Hammurabi - a law code from Babylon, in what is now Iraq - is nearly 4, 000 years old. It includes numerous clauses devoted to the topic of \"bottomry\", a kind of maritime insurance bundled together with a business loan. A merchant would borrow money to fund a ship\'s voyage, but if the ship sank, the loan did not have to be repaid. Around the same time, Chinese merchants were spreading their risks by swapping goods between ships. If any single ship went down, it would contain a mix of goods from many different merchants. But all that physical shuffling around is a fuss. Much more efficient to structure insurance as a financial contract instead, something the Romans did a few millennia later. Later still, Italian city states like Genoa and Venice developed ever more sophisticated ways to insure the ships of the Mediterranean. Thirst for news Then, in 1687, a coffee house opened on Tower Street, near the London docks. Run by Edward Lloyd, it was comfortable and spacious, and business boomed. Patrons enjoyed the fireside tea and coffee, and - of course - the gossip. There was much to gossip about: London\'s great plague, the great fire, the Dutch navy sailing up the Thames, and a revolution which had overthrown the king. But above all, the inhabitants of this coffee house loved to gossip about ships: what was sailing from where, with what cargo - and whether it would arrive safely or not. And where there was gossip, there was an opportunity for a wager. The patrons bet, for example, on whether Admiral John Byng would be shot for his incompetence in a naval battle with the French. He was. The gentlemen of Lloyd\'s would have had no qualms about taking my bet on my own life. Edward Lloyd realised his customers were as thirsty for information to fuel their bets as they were for coffee, and began to assemble a network of informants and a newsletter full of information about foreign ports, tides, and the comings and goings of ships. His newsletter became known as Lloyd\'s List. Lloyd\'s coffee house hosted ship auctions, and gatherings of sea captains who would share stories. If someone wished to insure a ship, that could be done too: a contract would be drawn up, and the insurer would sign his name underneath - hence the term \"underwriter\". It became hard to say quite where coffee-house gambling ended and formal insurance began. Eight decades after Lloyd had established his coffee house, a group of underwriters who hung out there formed the Society of Lloyd\'s. Today, Lloyd\'s of London is one of the most famous names in insurance. But not all modern insurers have their roots in gambling. Another form of insurance developed not in the ports, but the mountains. Alpine farmers organised mutual aid societies in the early 16th century, agreeing to look after each other if a cow - or child - fell ill. While the underwriters of Lloyd\'s viewed risk as something to be analysed and traded, the mutual assurance societies of the Alps saw it as something to be shared. And when the farmers descended from the alps to Zurich and Munich, they established some of the world\'s great insurance companies. Deep pools of risk Risk-sharing mutual aid societies are now among the largest and best-funded organisations on the planet - we call them \"governments\". Governments initially got into the insurance business as a way of making money, typically to fight a war in the turmoil of Europe in the 1600s and 1700s. Instead of selling ordinary bonds, which paid in regular instalments until they expired, governments sold annuities, which paid in regular instalments until the recipient expired. Easy to supply, and much in demand. Annuities are a form of insurance: they protect an individual against the risk of living so long that all their money runs out. More from Tim Harford Providing insurance is no longer a mere money-spinner for governments. It is regarded as a core priority to help citizens manage some of life\'s biggest risks - unemployment, illness, disability and ageing. Faced with these deep pools of risk, private insurers often merely paddle. At least, citizens in richer economies expect insurance from their governments. In poorer countries, governments are not much help against life-altering risks, such as crop failure or illness. And private insurers tend not to take much interest, either. The stakes are too low, and the costs too high. Blurred lines That is a shame, because there is growing evidence that insurance doesn\'t just provide peace of mind, but is a vital element of a healthy economy. A recent study in Lesotho showed that farmers were being held back from specialising and expanding by the risk of drought - a risk against which they couldn\'t insure themselves. When researchers created an insurance company and started selling crop insurance, the farmers bought the the insurance and expanded their businesses. Today, the biggest insurance market of all blurs the line between insuring and gambling: the market in financial derivatives. Derivatives are financial contracts that let two parties bet on something else - perhaps exchange rate fluctuations, or whether a debt will be repaid. They can be a form of insurance. An exporter hedges against a rise in the exchange rate. A wheat farming company covers itself by betting that the price of wheat will fall. The ability to buy derivatives lets companies specialise in a particular market. Otherwise, they would have to diversify - like the Chinese merchants four millennia ago, who didn\'t want all their goods in one ship. The more an economy specialises, the more it tends to produce. But unlike regular insurance, for derivatives you don\'t need to find someone with a risk they need to protect themselves against. You just need to find someone willing to take a gamble on any uncertain event anywhere in the world. It is a simple matter to double the stakes - or multiply them by a hundred. As the profits multiply, all that is needed is the appetite to take risks. Before the international banking crisis broke in 2007, the total face value of outstanding derivatives contracts was many times larger than the world economy itself. The real economy became the sideshow, the side bets became the main event. That story did not end well.

'The Night Manager: BBC drama set to return for series two A second series of award-winning drama The Night Manager is in development. the script was \"slowly being developed\" for the follow-up. Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman starred in the BBC One thriller, which was a hit last year. Its three stars won Golden Globes, while Danish director Bier won an Emmy Award. The series was based on John le Carre\'s 1993 novel - but the book does not have a sequel. Bier told Broadcast: \"We all very much want to do a season two, but the thing we absolutely do not want is to do something that does not live up to the level of season one. \"That would be a really bad idea.\"She was discussing the drama at Keshet\'s INTV conference in Jerusalem on Tuesday. More than nine million people watched the finale of The Night Manager on the BBC last March. Hiddleston played enigmatic Jonathan Pine, who goes undercover to expose billionaire arms dealer Richard Roper (Hugh Laurie). Hiddleston has said . Meanwhile, that fictional spy George Smiley will return in a new novel - the character\'s first appearance in print for 25 years. A Legacy of Spies will be published in September. The BBC is also adapting le Carre\'s The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, in which Smiley also appears, which will air next year. ',entertainment
'Article 50: Theresa May to trigger Brexit process next week Prime Minister Theresa May is to officially notify the European Union next Wednesday that the UK is leaving. Downing Street said she would write a letter to the European Council, adding that it hoped negotiations on the terms of exit and future relations could then begin as quickly as possible. An EU spokesman said it was \"ready and waiting\" for the letter. Mrs May\'s spokesman also rejected reports an early election may be held, saying: \"It\'s not going to happen.\"Under the Article 50 process, talks on the terms of exit and future relations are not allowed until the UK formally tells the EU it is leaving. If all goes according to the two year negotiations allowed for in the official timetable, Brexit should happen in March 2019. A No 10 spokesman said the UK\'s Ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, informed the European Council, headed by President Donald Tusk, earlier on Monday of the date that Article 50 would be triggered. Mrs May is expected to make a statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday shortly after invoking Article 50, setting out her aims. A spokesman said the government wants negotiations to start as soon as possible but added that they \"fully appreciate it is right that the other 27 EU states have time to agree their position\". The BBC\'s Ben Wright said he expected the Article 50 letter to be short, possibly extending to two pages at most, and for Mrs May to use it to publicly reiterate her general objectives - such as leaving the single market but reaching a mutually beneficial agreement on trade and other issues. \'Clear aims\' Speaking in Swansea on Monday, during the first of a series of visits around the UK before she triggers Article 50, Mrs May said she was intent on \"delivering on Brexit and getting the right deal\". Last year\'s referendum result, she added, \"was not just about leaving the EU\" but was a vote for a \"change in the way the country works\".\"Part of that is building a strong economy and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth and prosperity are felt across every part of the UK.\" Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK was now \"on the threshold of the most important negotiation for this country for a generation\".\"The government is clear in its aims,\" he said. \"A deal that works for every nation and region of the UK and indeed for all of Europe - a new, positive partnership between the UK and our friends and allies in the European Union.\"In response to the news, : \"Within 48 hours of the UK triggering Article 50, I will present the draft Brexit guidelines to the EU27 Member States.\"Mr Tusk has previously said he expects to call an extraordinary summit of the 27 other members within four to six weeks, to draw up a mandate for the European Commission\'s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Under this scenario, talks are likely to begin in earnest in May. Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\'s most senior representative at the EU, said the 27 had had plenty of time to prepare for this moment and he expected them to set out their stall \"pretty quickly\".\"Our mandate is clear, it is to get on with it,\" he told MPs on the European Scrutiny Committee. \"There is a timetable that everyone has bought into it.\"Mrs May said last year that she intended to notify the EU of the UK\'s intention to leave by the end of March. The move was approved by Parliament two weeks ago when peers and MPs passed unchanged a bill giving the prime minister the authority to set the process in motion. EU leaders have said they want to conclude the talks within 18 months to allow the terms of the UK\'s exit to be ratified by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament, as well as approved by the necessary majority of EU states. Mrs May has said MPs and peers will have a vote on the deal she negotiates but she has insisted the UK will leave anyway even if Parliament rejects it. The government has said it expects to secure a positive outcome but made clear there is a chance of there being no formal agreement with Mrs May saying no deal was better than a bad deal. Ahead of Mrs May naming the date European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was quoted in German newspaper Bild saying the UK may have to abandon hopes of getting a trade deal if it did not agree to the term offered by the EU. These terms may include a £50bn \"divorce bill\" and Mr Juncker said Brexit could bring the remaining 27 members closer together: \"They will all see from the UK\'s example that leaving the EU is a bad idea.\"Labour\'s Keir Starmer said the opposition would hold the government to account throughout the process, claiming the prime minister had failed to provide certainty about her plans or prepare for the \"clear dangers\" of not reaching a deal at all. The Scottish National Party\'s Europe spokesperson at Westminster, Stephen Gethins, said: \"Today\'s announcement... shatters beyond repair any notion or position that the Prime Minister is seeking a UK-wide agreement.\"For nine months since the EU referendum, there has been no attempt by the UK government to seek a meaningful discussion or agreement with the devolved administrations.\"Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, who has called for the public to have their say on the terms of exit in a further referendum, said Mrs May\'s decision to rule out membership of the single market before negotiations began was proof she was pursuing an \"extreme and divisive\" Brexit. \"Leaving the single market was not on the ballot paper in the referendum, it is a political choice made by Theresa May,\" he said. Later this week, EU leaders will gather in Rome to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, which established the European Economic Community - the initial forerunner to the EU. Mrs May is not attending the event. ',politics
'Fruit-shaped sensor \'can improve freshness\' A new fruit-shaped sensor could help cargo companies to keep fruit fresher in transit, researchers say. The device - which mimics the size, shape and composition of real fruit - is packed in with produce in transit and closely monitors its temperature. It comes in orange, apple, banana and mango varieties, and alerts firms to problems with their cooling processes, allowing them to take action. It could also lead to fresher fruit for consumers, researchers said. The project, which is still at the trial stage, is being conducted by the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa). Communications spokeswoman Cornelia Zogg : \"Mangos, bananas and oranges have usually travelled long distances by the time they reach our shops. \"However, not all the cargo makes it safely to its destination.\"Although fruit is inspected regularly, some of it is damaged or may even perish during the journey. This is because monitoring still has significant scope for improvement.\"Fruit destroyed The researchers say this creates risks for both suppliers and consumers. State food agencies can order container loads of fruit to be destroyed if it hasn\'t been stored at the right temperatures. And fruit which is overripe or not fresh can end up being sold to consumers.\"Cargo could be left outside during a layover, or you could have a power outage during transit, all of which affects quality,\" project leader Thijs Defraeye told the BBC.\"Exporters do have ways to measure freshness, but our sensor is more accurate because it simulates the characteristics of individual types of fruit.\" To achieve this, the team X-rayed real fruits and modelled their shape and texture, he says. They then determined the exact composition of each fruit\'s flesh and simulated it in a laboratory, using a mixture of water, carbohydrates and polystyrene. The mixture was poured into a fruit-shaped sensor mould, created on a 3D printer. Mr Defraeye said: \"If something goes wrong, suppliers will be able to access the temperature data from the whole journey and work out what happened. \"We hope this will help them control their sanitary protocols and cut the cost and time of logistics.\"Field tests for the sensors are under way and the researchers are looking for potential commercial partners.

'Toshiba looking to sell Westinghouse nuclear business Toshiba president Satoshi Tsunakawa has said the company may sell its majority stake in US nuclear unit Westinghouse. The struggling electronics firm bought Westinghouse in 2006, but it has suffered huge cost over-runs. Toshiba has also been given permission to delay reporting its earnings for a second time - this time until 11 April. Mr Tsunakawa said: \"We are working on nurturing our growth businesses to return to stable growth by fiscal years 2018 and 2019.\"Shares in the company rallied late on Tuesday, closing up 0. 5\% in Tokyo after earlier falling by nearly 9\%. In February, Toshiba\'s and the firm delayed publishing its results over disagreements with its auditors. Last month, the firm announced a 712. 5bn yen ($6. 3bn; £5bn) writedown because some of its US nuclear assets were worth far less than estimated. The situation has led some analysts to warn that the Nuclear losses While often still associated with its technology products, Toshiba has become a diverse conglomerate. Its nuclear services business brings in about a third of its revenue. However, that side of the business has not made a profit since 2013 and nuclear services globally are struggling since the Fukushima disaster in 2011. Toshiba had initially alerted investors in December 2016 that it faced a heavy one-off loss linked to a deal done by Westinghouse. Assets that it took on are likely to be worth less than initially thought and there is also a dispute about payments that are due. Requesting permission for the new delay to its results, Toshiba said some US senior managers had exerted \"inappropriate pressure\" in the way the acquisition of a nuclear plant construction company had been dealt with in its accounts. Selling assets Since December\'s announcement, Toshiba shares have lost more than half of their value. To offset the upcoming writedown, Toshiba is also rushing to sell most or even all its prized memory chip business, which it thinks is worth at least $13bn. The company is the second largest chipmaker in the world, behind Samsung. Toshiba is also still struggling to recover from a scandal in 2015, when it emerged that profits had been overstated for seven years. The news prompted the chief executive to resign. ',business
'Zara Larsson: The pop star with sleep paralysis In Sweden, she\'s been a star since she was 10 - but Zara Larsson has her eyes set on global domination. Aged just 19, the star has racked up seven hits in the last 14 months, including the tropical pop smash , which spent more than a year on the charts. Along the way, she\'s collaborated with and sung the , but the highlight of her year was supporting Beyonce at Wembley Stadium.\"It was the best show on a tour I\'ve ever seen. Wembley\'s such an incredible stadium. It\'s definitely one of the stadiums I want to stand on and have my own tour, one day.\"Although she\'s already scored a number one single and album in her home country, Zara is starting from scratch in the UK - and releases her debut album, , this week. Outgoing and dynamic, she talked the BBC through her career to date. Here\'s everything you need to know (and a few things you probably didn\'t) about Sweden\'s latest pop sensation. She suffers from sleep paralysis Writing on her two years ago, the 19-year-old revealed she frequently has episodes of sleep paralysis.\"Oh my God, it\'s scary!\" she tells the BBC. \"Basically, you wake up and you literally cannot move. Your brain is active, but your body is not yet awake. \"It\'s weird. It lasts half a minute maybe - but it kind of feels like you\'re trapped there for half an hour.\"I get it a lot when I\'m stressed out, or when I have a lot of things going on.\"But Zara says there\'s an upside, too. Often, as she falls asleep, she\'s overcome by a sense of tremendous wellbeing (to paraphrase a certain Blur song).\"It\'s like a wave comes over me. Energy is just vibrating through your body and it\'s awesome.\" She\'s shaken off her talent show past In 2008, Zara entered Talang Sverige - Sweden\'s version of Britain\'s Got Talent - mainly because there was no age restriction, unlike X Factor or Swedish Idol. Singing a heavily-accented, but vocally powerful, version of Celine Dion\'s , she won the contest, and its 500, 000 krona (£42, 600) prize.\"I sounded like a little guinea pig!\" she laughs. But, incredibly, the contest led to nothing. \"Nobody really wanted to sign me, which I was devastated about,\" she says. \"I was like, \'oh my gosh, my career\'s over and it hasn\'t even started yet!\'\"I didn\'t really want to do anything with Nickelodeon or Disney, so I just went back to school.\"The break may have saved her. Rather than becoming a novelty act, washed up before she was a teenager, Zara re-emerged as a bona fide pop artist on her 15th birthday, with an EP that turned people\'s heads.\"When I released the first song, a lot of the people didn\'t even recognise me,\" she says. \"And the people that did were like, \'Oh my gosh, it\'s her!\' \"So in Sweden, the talent show is like super-irrelevant. And that\'s great because usually it\'s very hard to wipe off that kind of Got Talent stain. \"It just stays on you - but it didn\'t for me.\" She doesn\'t listen to other bands at festivals ...

It\'s not a bad comparison to have but I\'m never going to be Rihanna, and I\'m not trying to be. Don\'t expect her to hold back on social media From the moment Zara fired up her Instagram, and called out guys who \"think they\'re too big to wear protection\", it was clear Zara wouldn\'t be sticking to the record company script. Since then, she\'s voiced her support for Kesha - who is suing famed record producer Dr Luke for alleged sexual assault - and engaged in a war of words with R&amp; B star Chris Brown, calling him \"a sexist, homophobic, transphobic trash\".\"That\'s who I am,\" says the star. \"I don\'t really have a \'vision\' of who I want people to see me as. \"I just post whatever I feel like.\" Her dad could have you killed (probably) Larsson was born in Stockholm at the tail end of the 1990s, moving to the suburbs when her younger sister Hanna was born.

Far from it.\"My dad was a military man, working in Navy intelligence,\" she says, \"so I know he can keep secrets, definitely.\"While the exact nature of his job remains classified, Larsson swears he was the model parent.\"He\'s great and he\'s funny. You can ask him whatever and he always has the answer. Even if he doesn\'t, he will never admit it. So we had a lot of debates and discussions. That\'s the reason why I\'m interested in everything. \"Now he\'s actually studying again - he wants to be a professor in war science.\"Potential boyfriends beware. She won\'t sing lyrics that disrespect women Zara\'s breakout hit in the UK was - a duet with British producer MNEK that was written in just two hours. \"We work really well together,\" she marvels. \"It\'s just no question marks. I feel very relaxed and honest and open with him. \"They collaborated again on , a sassy, sexy club track that became Zara\'s fifth top 20 hit, late last year.\"We wrote it in five minutes,\" says Zara, \"Originally, it was about me stealing someone else\'s man. I was saying, \'It ain\'t my fault that you\'re not cute enough for him.\'\"But after submitting the song to her record label, the singer had second thoughts.\"I was just like, \'Wait, hold up, I can\'t sing this\'. It just didn\'t feel right. It felt like I\'d broken the girl code, and I didn\'t want to do that.\" Exercise is not her friend As a child, Zara attended the Royal Swedish Ballet School. \"I was very flexible,\" she says. \"It really taught me a lot about discipline and how to use my body. But these days I\'m about as flexible as a… erm, a safe!\"In fact, she\'s so out of shape that a brief session with her personal trainer ended in disaster.\"I ran 200 metres and my trainer said, \'That was a great job, you ran pretty fast\'. \"I said, \'I know!\' so he told me to do it a second time. And when I came back, I threw up.\" Her goal is to keep improving \"I\'m on my way to becoming a true performer,\" shortly after singing Lush Life on The Voice UK last year. So, does she not consider herself a fully-qualified pop phenomenon yet?\"You\'re never finished,\" she says. \"My inspiration for performing is Beyonce. I don\'t think Beyonce ever wakes up and thinks, \'Oh great I\'m Beyonce, I\'m just going to chill today.\'\"She wants to be better, she wants to do bigger things and she wants to keep on evolving. \"That\'s what makes her great, and that\'s what I want to do.\" ',entertainment
'U-turn over Budget plan to increase National Insurance Plans to increase National Insurance rates for self-employed people - announced in the Budget last week - have been dropped. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said the government will not proceed with the increases which were criticised for breaking a 2015 manifesto pledge. He told MPs in a Commons statement: \"There will be no increases in National Insurance rates in this Parliament.\"Labour\'s Jeremy Corbyn said the U-turn showed a government \"in chaos\". Mr Hammond had faced a backlash by Conservative backbenchers last week, who accused him of breaking a general election manifesto commitment not to put up National Insurance, income tax or VAT. Explaining his change of heart to MPs, the chancellor said: \"It is very important both to me and to the prime minister that we are compliant not just with the letter, but also the spirit of the commitments that were made.\"In the light of what has emerged as a clear view among colleagues and a significant section of the public, I have decided not to proceed with the Class 4 NIC measure set out in the Budget.\" Mr Hammond\'s Budget announcement would have increased Class 4 NICs from 9\% to 10\% in April 2018, and to 11\% in 2019, to bring it closer to the 12\% currently paid by employees. He said \"most commentators\" believed the \"sharp increase\" in self-employment over the last few years had in part been \"driven by differences in tax treatment\". He would use the Autumn Budget to set out further measures to \"fund in full\" the £2bn lost from NICs, he said. But Tom McPhail, Hargreaves Lansdown\'s head of retirement policy, argued the U-turn would increase pressure in other areas of fiscal policy - and \"may increase the risk of further pension tax tinkering in the Autumn Budget\". Labour\'s shadow chancellor John McDonnell described the climb-down as \"chaos - it\'s shocking and humiliating that you have been forced to come here to reverse a key budget decision announced less than a week ago\". He told him to spend less time writing \"stale jokes\" for his Budget speech, and turning on the prime minister sitting next to him, he added she should also have spent less time \"guffawing like a feeding seal\". Analysis: By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg It undermines the credibility of the chancellor, an admission at the very least, that his political antennae have gone wonky. Second, it questions the extent to which the prime minister is willing to back him. Relations between the next door neighbours are businesslike and between their operations certainly frosty - and this will not have improved things at all. It also tells us that although polling suggests the prime minister is strong in the country, she\'s simply not that strong in Parliament. A firm nudge from backbenchers, and they shifted. Asked by former SNP leader Alex Salmond \"who\" had realised the Budget was in \"flagrant breach\" of a manifesto commitment, Mr Hammond replied: \"I think it was Laura Kuenssberg on the BBC shortly after I said it in the Budget speech.\"Former Labour leadership contender Yvette Cooper rounded on the comment, saying she was \"slightly astonished\" to hear that - and asked why nobody at Number 10 or 11 Downing Street had checked the Conservative manifesto before he went on to write the Budget. Mr Hammond clarified that he had meant Ms Kuenssberg \"was the first person after I spoke to raise the issue outside\". Theresa May had confirmed the U-turn at Prime Minister\'s Questions, insisting that last week\'s Budget announcements were consistent with the government commitment not to raise tax. Stressing the need to \"maintain fairness in the tax system\", she said she would await publication of the Taylor Report on the future of employment and consider the government\'s overall approach to employment status, rights and entitlements before deciding what to do next. But Mr Corbyn said the government should \"apologise\" for the stress the announcement had caused Britain\'s 4. 8m self-employed. The SNP\'s Westminster leader Angus Robertson accused ministers of a \"screeching, embarrassing U-turn\" - while Labour\'s shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted that the chancellor\'s authority had been \"shredded\". Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, an advocate of Britain remaining in the EU, questioned whether the chancellor would \"now U-turn on another broken election commitment to keep us in the single market\". Chris Bryce, CEO of the self-employed body IPSE, welcomed the U-turn, saying \"hard working people will sleep easier tonight\" - while Stephen Herring, the Institute of Directors\' head of taxation, said the National Insurance \"saga can only be described as chaotic\". Beyond the political ramifications of Philip Hammond\'s U-turn on the Budget tax rise for the self-employed, the Treasury now has a new problem - the increase in the National Insurance rate was due to raise over £2bn by 2022. Its reversal, with no prospect of any replacement direct tax increases this Parliament, makes the government pledge to \"balance the books\" even more difficult to honour. And that makes the Autumn Budget a trickier prospect - it was heavily briefed last week that the National Insurance rise was to pay for spending commitments on social care and business rate support. Income tax, National Insurance contributions and VAT raise 65\% of the government\'s tax income. If you pledge not to raise any of them, your room for manoeuvre is severely limited. ',politics
'Towards a lip-reading computer Scientists at Oxford say they\'ve invented an artificial intelligence system that can lip-read better than humans. The system, which has been trained on thousands of hours of BBC News programmes, has been developed in collaboration with Google\'s DeepMind AI division.\"Watch, Attend and Spell\", as the system has been called, can now watch silent speech and get about 50\% of the words correct. That may not sound too impressive - but when the researchers supplied the same clips to professional lip-readers, they got only 12\% of words right. Joon Son Chung, a doctoral student at Oxford University\'s Department of Engineering, explained to me just how challenging a task this is. \"Words like mat, bat and pat all have similar mouth shapes.\" It\'s context that helps his system - or indeed a professional lip reader - to understand what word is being spoken.\"What the system does,\" explains Joon, \"is to learn things that come together, in this case the mouth shapes and the characters and what the likely upcoming characters are.\" The BBC supplied the Oxford researchers with clips from Breakfast, Newsnight, Question Time and other BBC news programmes, with subtitles aligned with the lip movements of the speakers. Then a neural network combining state-of-the-art image and speech recognition set to work to learn how to lip-read. After examining 118, 000 sentences in the clips, the system now has 17, 500 words stored in its vocabulary. Because it has been trained on the language of news, it is now quite good at understanding that \"Prime\" will often be followed by \"Minister\" and \"European\" by \"Union\", but much less adept at recognising words not spoken by newsreaders. A lot more work needs to be done before the system is put to practical use, but the charity Action on Hearing Loss is enthusiastic about this latest advance. \"AI lip-reading technology would be able to enhance the accuracy and speed of speech to text,\" says Jesal Vishnuram, the charity\'s technology research manager. \"This would help people with subtitles on TV, and with hearing in noisy surroundings.\" Right now the system has limitations - it can only operate on full sentences of recorded video. \"We want to get it to work in real time,\" says Joon Son Chung. \"As it keeps watching TV, it will learn.\" And he says getting the system to work live is a lesser challenge than improving its accuracy. He sees all sorts of potential uses for this technology, from helping people to dictate instructions to their smartphones in noisy environments, to dubbing old silent films. In many cases, the AI lip-reading system could be used to improve the performance of other forms of speech recognition. Where the Oxford researchers and the hearing loss charity agree, is on the fact that this is not a case where AI is going to replace humans. Professional lip-readers need not fear for their jobs - but they can look forward to a time when technology helps them become a lot more accurate.',tech

To add insult to injury, she says he then told her that she wasn\'t qualified to run her own business. And all this while he ordered the most expensive main course, and told Ms Nuttall that she\'d have to foot the entire bill. \"It was the worst,\" says Ms Nuttall, 42. Perilous menu First things first, a business lunch isn\'t going out for a bite to eat with your mates from the office - that\'s socialising with colleagues. It is instead a business meeting, usually in a restaurant, and typically with someone from another organisation, or at least someone who doesn\'t work in your team. And the conversation will include business matters - be it talk about a sale, agreement or understanding that benefits both parties. You might think that going for a business lunch is a simple thing, but it is in fact beset with a whole menu of potential perils and pratfalls. From the choice of venue, to what food you pick, whether you order alcohol, and how you share the bill, any number of things can go wrong. Talking politics and religion is almost always a complete no-no, but what if an innocent chat about current affairs quickly turns to President Trump, Brexit or Scottish independence? We asked some etiquette experts and business coaches to guide us through the minefield.\'Avoid messy food\' The first issue for someone organising a business lunch is the choice of restaurant.\"You need to find somewhere with a careful balance of ambience,\" says Jenny Flintoft, a leadership consultant based in the north of England. \"I tend to favour a restaurant that is buzzy enough that conversations can be had without being overheard in a deathly quiet restaurant, but not one that has lots of background music, as the voice raising makes having a meaningful conversation very difficult.\"Ms Flintoft also notes the importance of choosing the right dishes.\"I personally steer clear of corn on the cob, as it can easily get stuck in teeth,\" she says. \"[I would also avoid] spaghetti or foods with sloppy sauces, or anything that requires a lot of effort to eat, such as shellfish.\"During a business luncheon I want to concentrate on my fellow diner, not battling with the meal.\"To drink or not? You also need to bear in mind the ethical or religious food rules that the other person may follow. For example, ordering the foie gras followed by the veal might not be a great idea, and booking a restaurant that specialises in suckling pig could cause offence. When you have reserved a table in a hopefully appropriate restaurant, one of the biggest questions that lunchtime is - to drink, or not to drink? British etiquette expert Jo Bryant says that alcohol is best avoided because the social atmosphere of a restaurant \"can easily let us forget that the lunch is for business purposes\". She continues: \"Add in a glass or two and you might be at risk of relaxing too much, and saying or agreeing to do something you might regret.\"It is important to stay sharp and maintain your professional gloss.\" However, London-based business coach Phil Jones suggests a middle ground when it comes to the wine list. \"Allow the other person to take the lead,\" he says. \"Sometimes it is a loosening of the collar.\"It\'s a chance to get some deeper issues, to speak a bit freer.\"\'No sex or politics\' Even without alcohol, conversations over a business lunch can all too easily go awry. Ms Flintoft says: \"Some people launch very quickly into diatribes about a particular hot [political] potato, and there\'s a lot of those around at the moment, which makes me question their judgement.\"But there needs to be a good mix of genuine conversation versus pitching.\" Ms Nuttall says there should be a number of \"no-fly\" discussions. \"There should be absolutely no talking about sex, politics, religion, bad talking other people or companies, or negatives about your own company or theirs.\"Mr Jones says people should also guard against venting any personal problems they might be struggling with.\"One man\'s wife was having an affair, and I was the first person he\'d confided in,\" he says.\"I was given the role of therapist by someone who was a complete stranger to me.\"Who pays? Wherever the lunch, and whatever the topic, William Hanson, a UK etiquette coach advises being mindful of the other person\'s time.\"The worst ones are where they drag on and your host thinks you don\'t have anywhere else to be,\" he says. When it comes to picking up the tab at the end of the meal Mr Hanson has a simple rule.\"Whoever extended the invitation, and has made the reservation, pays,\" he says. To avoid any awkwardness or uncertainty when the bill arrives, Mr Hanson suggests that the inviter goes one stage further, and gives his or her credit card details to the restaurant ahead of the meal.\"It takes away the nasty money dilemma at the end,\" he says. Mr Hanson takes a more relaxed approach though if a lunch with a particular client or associate becomes a regular event. Under such circumstances he says that a \"turn-taking arrangement can often be struck\". Ms Nuttall adds that she often thinks that if one of the parties has travelled a long distance, they should be treated to lunch. But normally she suggests that the bill should generally be split equally. Follow Business Brain series editor Will Smale on Twitter ',business
'Maggie Rogers: After wowing Pharrell, she\'s delivered an EP of blissful, rural pop Maggie Rogers has been making albums since she was in school, but she suddenly became famous last year when a video of her meeting Pharrell went viral. Rogers was studying songwriting and production in New York last March, when the star to give some tips. As he listened to her song Alaska - a supple blend of acoustic rhythms and soaring harmonies - Pharrell\'s eyes grew wider, then wider still.\"Wow, I have zero, zero, zero notes,\" he told her when the track finished, his socks well and truly blown off (not that Pharrell wears socks - but if he did, they would have been vaporised.) \"Your whole story, I can hear it in the music. I\'ve never heard anyone like you before.\" The video of their encounter, which has been watched 2. 5 million times on YouTube, changed Rogers\' life. Alaska is nudging 30 million streams on Spotify; while the singer-songwriter has won rave reviews for her new EP, Now That The Light Is Fading, all around the world.\"I\'ve been studying and preparing to do this my entire life [but] I never imagined in a million years that is the way it would happen,\" she tells the BBC. Excruciating The 22-year-old had no warning that Pharrell would be attending her class that day. She simply brought along her latest demo, the way she did every week. \"It was our regular homework to bring in songs, or you\'d be failed,\" she says. Although she was used to having her work critiqued, the whole experience was excruciating. While the song played, all eyes (and a camera crew) were focused on the musician. Wisely, Rogers picked a point on the floor and stared at it for a full three minutes.\"It\'s always really important to me that when other people are listening to my song, I\'m really still and quiet so I\'m not influencing them,\" she explains. \"But then there\'s this weird dichotomy between making sure you don\'t look too interested in your song, but not looking like you\'re bored. So halfway through I remembered I was on camera and that I needed to look confident in my work!\"She was pleased with the feedback she received, but didn\'t expect anything more. When class finished, she turned off her phone, went for a walk in Chinatown, then ended up at her friends\' house, where she worked on a new song.\"I don\'t have a lot of memories from that day,\" she says. \"I was pretty much in a daze.\" It was three months before the video went viral. Rogers was inevitably dubbed \"the Pharrell girl\" - but she isn\'t too bothered.\"There are a lot worse things to be,\" she says. \"I have a lot of respect for Pharrell and the way he handles public life with such incredible grace and humanity.\"He always continues to creatively challenge himself, whether it\'s in music or film or fashion. I have all the same ambitions, so I find it really inspiring.\"Rural pop Born in rural Maryland, Rogers started playing harp and piano at the age of seven, and wrote her first song by the time she was 13.\"It became this thing that was just how I processed my life,\" she says. \"I would write a song about however I was feeling and then just play it over and over again to make myself feel better, until I was feeling something else and then I\'d write another song.\"While attending boarding school in Delaware, she fell in love with the banjo and turned a school broom cupboard into a prototype recording studio. Her early records leaned towards folk, inspired by her art teacher\'s record collection. (\"There wasn\'t really any internet, so I\'d listen to a lot of Bob Dylan, Carole King and Cat Stevens,\" she says). She submitted those demos as part of her application to New York University\'s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music - which is where that fateful meeting with Pharrell took place. But, having worked towards the goal of becoming a professional musician for a decade, she suddenly found herself unable to create.\"I was changing, just like most people do in college,\" she says. \"I was going through a lot and I wasn\'t really sure what I wanted to sound like. I had a lot of difficulty writing or reflecting.\"It was really stressful. I was 21 and thinking, \'I spent my entire life being really focused on this one thing. What happens if this isn\'t for me?\'\" A term studying abroad in Europe set her back on track. There, the musician encountered dance music for the first time after friends dragged her to the clubs of Paris and Berlin.\"Going to a club in New York meant high heels and expensive cocktails, or at least that was my impression. But to watch all these different people - age, race, gender - moving in the exact same way to the music was incredible. \"It filled me with so much joy, to dance. It was such a release.\"Re-energised, she resolved to marry her instinct for melody to something more rhythmical. \"I had made quiet music my entire life,\" she says. \"I was ready to make something that was loud.\"\"I really love pop music, It was Carly Rae Jepsen\'s last record [2015\'s E•MO•TION] that inspired me to make pop in the first place. That record is so good. I\'d call that slumber party pop,\" she enthusesBut rather than replicate Jepsen\'s retro pop sounds, or churning out cheap imitations of the EDM she\'d heard in Europe, Rogers aimed to make \"pop music that feels as organic as possible\". So the rhythm on Alaska was created by patting her jeans; while her EP is peppered with sounds and imagery she discovered on her regular hiking trips (around her neck, she wears two elk vertebrae she discovered in Oregon - they\'ll be used as percussion in a future recording).\"I studied natural sounds and bird sounds,\" says the musician. \"The Smithsonian has a really incredible catalogue of indigenous music. I was looking at the ways in which rhythm appeared in daily life - because I didn\'t really have any experience of pop music, but I did have experience of being outside. \"So I was looking for the ways in which rhythm most appears naturally. I also thought that if I could replicate the rhythms we hear every day in my music, it would already sound warm and familiar when you started listening.\" Listening to the EP proves her instincts were correct. There\'s a startling intimacy to Rogers\' rural pop, as the airy arrangements complement her graceful, multi-tracked vocals. As Pharrell observed, it\'s completely unique. But Rogers is certain that other pop artists share her way of thinking.\"I think we\'re getting to a point where computers and technology don\'t define electronic music any more. Like James Blake\'s record, The Colour In Anything, there\'s so many wonderful moments on that record where electronic production is an accessory without dominating his work.\"Electronic integration is something that will change the sound of music.\"Fans clamouring to hear more from Rogers might have a long wait on their hands, though. She\'s not written a note since last March, when she completed the songs on the current EP. Since then, life has been too hectic.\"I can\'t write on the road,\" she says. \"It takes a lot of quiet and a lot of alone time.\"If I have four days to write, I\'ll sleep, or be really quiet, for three days in a row and write on the fourth.\"But I really, really feel very urgent about writing right now. Hopefully soon.\"Hopefully soon. ',entertainment
'Northern Ireland could face another snap election, says Brokenshire Northern Ireland could face another election if political parties cannot reach agreement within three weeks, James Brokenshire has said. The Northern Ireland Secretary warned that there would be \"significant consequences\" if there is no deal to restore Stormont\'s devolved government. An election to the Northern Ireland Assembly was held last Thursday, which . Talks are being held to restore Stormont\'s power-sharing executive. In a letter to MPs, Mr Brokenshire said that if the discussions fail there would be no executive or budget, causing \"risks to public services\". \"Ultimately, we would also be facing a second election,\" he added. That, he said, would bring \"disruption and uncertainty for businesses and the people of Northern Ireland\". After last week\'s election, Sinn Féin now holds just one seat fewer in the assembly than the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Under Northern Ireland\'s power-sharing agreement, the executive must be jointly run by unionists and nationalists, with the largest party being invited to put forward a candidate for first minister. Ultimately, if no executive is formed, power could return to the UK parliament at Westminster for the first time in a decade. But in his letter, Mr Brokenshire wrote that he was \"not contemplating any other outcome but a resumption of devolved government as soon as possible\". Meanwhile, DUP leader Arlene Foster has said she regrets ahead of last week\'s election. In an , Mrs Foster said Sinn Féin was able to use the comment against her. At an election campaign event, she said she would not \"capitulate\" to Sinn Féin demands for an Irish language act, adding: \"If you feed a crocodile they\'re going to keep coming back and looking for more.\"Asked by the Impartial Reporter if she regretted making the remarks, Mrs Foster said: \"I regret in so far as it allowed Sinn Féin to use it against me and to use it to demonise me.\"Sinn Féin mounted a campaign of demonisation against me and to a certain extent succeeded in that.\"\'On the table\' Talks are continuing between Northern Ireland\'s political parties and the UK and Irish governments. Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan said progress in the discussions had been \"slow\" but he did \"detect a willingness on the part of everybody to do business\". On the suggestion of another snap election, Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said Mr Brokenshire \"can threaten all sorts of things\" but \"needs to understand he has responsibilities as well\".\"[The UK government] have taken their eye off the ball in the last number of months and years,\" he added.\"If they think they can place the blame on everybody else, they\'re barking up the wrong tree.\"Sinn Féin\'s northern leader Michelle O\'Neill criticised the UK government over its stance, so far, on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles and proposals for an Irish language act. \"We haven\'t seen anything being put on the table by the British government on how we can deliver on the key issues,\" Mrs O\'Neill said.\"The British government need to deliver on basic human rights and not pander to the DUP.\"The Alliance Party\'s deputy leader Stephen Farry said the parties \"need to see the talks picking up the pace in the coming days\". He added: \"If there was another election there would be a huge frustration from the people of Northern Ireland.\"People shouldn\'t be called out to the polls time after time after time, simply because the politicians can\'t do their jobs.\" The Ulster Unionists said the Irish government had not fulfilled its responsibilities over dealing with the legacy of the Troubles. Tom Elliott, the party\'s chief negotiator, said the 1976 murders of 10 Protestant workmen at Kingsmills in County Armagh, was a sticking point in the talks. Two years ago, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny it held in relation to the attack to a coroner for an inquest into the killings. Some of the victims\' families are unhappy with the level of information given by the Irish government.\"Unless they are going to bring us more information and bring those victims more information then I feel they are failing in their duties,\" Mr Elliott said. In a statement, the Irish government said relevant material sought by the coroner \"has already been provided to the inquest in accordance with the government\'s commitment\" and it is in contact with the coroner to see how else it can assist in the inquest.',politics
'Germany warns social media firms over illegal content Social media firms in Germany could face fines of up to 50 million euros if they take too long to remove illegal content including fake news. Germany\'s justice minister has drafted a law that seeks to impose the fines as part of efforts to police toxic chat. Heiko Maas said the voluntary efforts of social networks to tackle the problem had not gone far enough. The proposal requires sites to run 24-hour helplines and to delete flagged content within seven days.\'Utterly impossible\' Social media firms such as Twitter and Facebook were getting better at handling illegal content, said Mr Maas, but both had a long way to go. Mr Maas quoted research which suggested Twitter deletes only 1\% of the hate speech it is told about by users, and Facebook, 39\%.\"This isn\'t sufficient yet,\" said Mr Maas. Racism and hate speech are believed to have become more prevalent on German social media following the arrival of large number of refugees in Germany. Any content that was \"clearly criminal\" would have to be removed within 24 hours under conditions outlined in the draft law. If, after an investigation, content is found to be criminal then that must be removed in seven days. The people who posted the illegal content must also be told about its deletion. The proposed law would require each network to run fully staffed, round-the-clock reporting systems and to name an individual responsible for handling complaints. That person could face an individually levied fine of five million euros if companies break laws governing what can be published. Mr Maas said the law could apply to fake news articles if they proved to be slanderous, defamatory or libellous. Facebook did not comment directly on the proposal but said tests it commissioned showed it removed a higher percentage of illegal content than Mr Maas claimed. The social network said it expected to have 700 people employed in Berlin by the end of 2017 overseeing its efforts to review flagged content. German digital trade association Bitkom criticised the proposed law. It told the Financial Times that the requirement to remove material within 24 hours on sites that handle more than one billion posts per day was \"utterly impossible to implement in operational terms\".',tech
'Football League: Cavan and Monaghan win in Division One Cavan pulled off a surprise 1-14 to 0-15 win over Mayo in Castlebar to give themselves a fighting chance of avoiding relegation from Division One. Gearoid McKiernan\'s goal proved crucial as the Ulster county defied the odds for their first win of the campaign. The shock victory was Cavan\'s first in the top division for 13 years. Meanwhile, Monaghan are level with the leaders in Division One after a 2-17 to 1-13 win over pointless Roscommon who looked doomed to relegation. Forwards Conor McManus and Jack McCarron did most of the damage, scoring 1-10 between them. McCarron toe-poked in the first goal on 53 minutes with substitute Owen Duffy also finding the net. Roscommon keeper Darren O\'Malley made two vital saves in the first half to prevent earlier goals. Tadgh O\'Rourke scored a consolation goal for Roscommon but, having lost all five of their matches, Kevin McStay\'s side appear destined for the drop to Division Two. Monaghan are in a four-way tie at the top of the division with Dublin, Donegal and Tyrone on seven points. But it was Cavan\'s unexpected success which provided the story of the day in the top flight. Mayo had looked in control, leading nine points to five heading into first-half stoppage-time. But it all changed when McKiernan - the only Cavan player to score a league goal this year - smashed the ball past Mayo keeper David Clarke to reduce the gap to a single point. The sides were level going into the last five minutes and points by Dara McVeety and Joe Dillon secured victory for the side rated 4-1 outsiders before throw-in. ',sport
'Warren Buffett upbeat on US business growth US billionaire Warren Buffett has backed American businesses to continue to create \"mind-boggling\" wealth. The investment guru, known as the \"Sage of Omaha\", said US stocks were \"virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead\". Mr Buffett steered clear of mentioning President Trump in his in his investment firm. But he did praise \"a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants\" in helping the US economy to prosper. Mr Buffett, who supported Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the US presidential election, did not address Donald Trump\'s policies. But he took an upbeat view of the US economy, repeating his claim that \"babies born in America today are the luckiest crop in history\". Mr Buffett\'s comments came as his firm Berkshire Hathaway, which owns dozens of US stocks including Apple, Coca-Cola and the four biggest US airlines, reported a 15\% rise in fourth-quarter profits to $6. 3bn (£5bn). Stock success However, over the course of the year it underperformed the S&amp; P 500 share index for the fourth time in the last five years. The growth in the company\'s book value - that is the company\'s assets minus its liabilities and Mr Buffett\'s preferred measure of Berkshire\'s performance - was 10. 7\% in 2016, while the S&amp; P 500 rose 12. 0\%. Mr Buffett said investors \"will almost certainly do well\" by staying with a \"collection of large, conservatively financed American businesses\". The gifted stock-picker, who is on course to win a 2008 bet that an investment in the S&amp; P 500 would beat five hedge funds over 10 years, also took a fresh swipe at highly paid \"active\" investment managers. He said \"1, 000 monkeys would be just as likely to produce a seemingly all-wise prophet\" as 1, 000 highly paid professionals.\'Epitaph\' However, one investment manager said he felt Mr Buffett spent too much of the letter extolling Berkshire\'s virtues and did not address what went wrong with Kraft Heinz\'s . The letter was more about Mr Buffett\'s \"epitaph even more so than prior letters\", said Cole Smead of Smead Capital Management. Last week, Kraft, in which Berkshire is a major investor, dropped its $143bn (£115bn) takeover attempt amid strong opposition from Unilever\'s board. Mr Buffet has previously spoken against hostile takeovers - where firms try to buy out shareholders directly without support from the target\'s board. ',business

'George Osborne warns against leaving EU without trade deal George Osborne has warned that leaving the European Union without any trade deal would amount to \"the biggest act of protectionism in British history.\"The ex-chancellor told business leaders that the UK could not rely on new trade deals beyond Europe after Brexit. But Boris Johnson said the UK could be \"ever-more European and ever-more internationalist\" at the same time. The foreign secretary said there was \"every reason\" to believe a \"win-win\" EU deal could be done within two years. Downing Street said Prime Minister Theresa May was \"confident and optimistic\" about striking a comprehensive free trade agreement. No 10 also said Brexit Secretary David Davis had told cabinet on Tuesday that the UK must prepare itself for the \"unlikely scenario\" this could not be achieved. In another development, a senior Nissan executive has told MPs the car maker may \"adjust\" its business in the UK dependent on the outcome of Brexit. Colin Lawther said Nissan, which in October committed to building two new models at its Sunderland plant, would \"constantly review\" its decision in light of any major changes and the firm believed remaining in the customs union was vital. The government is expected to notify the EU of its intention to leave next month, paving the way for a two-year negotiation over the terms of exit and the shape of the UK\'s future relationship with the EU. Theresa May has said no deal would be better than a bad one and indicated she would be prepared to see the UK revert to World Trade Organisation trading rules in the absence of any agreement. \'Big neighbours\' Mr Osborne, who campaigned to remain in the EU but was sacked by Mrs May after she took power in July, told business leaders that he recognised that the UK would be leaving the EU and he was not seeking to \"fight the last war\". But he said leaving the EU without a proper agreement would impose significant costs on the British economy, with up to half of all British exports facing tariffs and additional regulations for trading with EU. \"Let\'s make sure that we go on doing trade with our biggest export market,\" he said.\"Otherwise withdrawing from the single market will be the biggest single act of protectionism in the history of the United Kingdom.\"And no amount of trade deals with New Zealand are going to replace the trade that we do at the moment with our big European neighbours.\"He also expressed doubts about whether a special customs arrangement could be agreed with the EU replicating the existing benefits of the customs union.\'Boo word\' Critics of Brexit, including former prime ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major, have warned that there is little chance any new trade deal could match the advantages of the UK\'s current membership of the single market. But speaking at the same conference, Mr Johnson said he had had enough of hearing people \"droning on and moaning about the state of the world\".\"Since June 2016, the sky has obstinately failed to fall in,\" he said. The UK\'s interests, he added, had not been best served by delegating its trade policy to the EU and that the UK had a \"unique global quality\" which meant it would be able to maximise the opportunities provided by Brexit. He said he regretted the fact that globalisation had become a \"boo word in the political lexicon\", saying it had been a \"liberating and enriching force\" in lifting millions out of poverty and contributing to peace and prosperity in Europe. The UK, he added, had an \"unrivalled opportunity\" to do a \"fantastic\" deal with the EU, given their trading standards, rules and tariffs were already harmonised. \"Of course we remain committed to our European markets, perhaps more so than ever but we need to think globally again because a global Britain is a safer, more successful and more prosperous Britain.\"Ministers have said that although no new trade deals can be signed until the UK leaves the EU, a host of countries are keen to talk to the UK about the prospects.',politics
'Uber stops using Greyball \'secret program\' to dodge regulators Uber says it will ban a secret software tool from being used to evade undercover regulators. The software, called Greyball, seeks to identify officials around the world trying to catch Uber drivers operating illegally. It then denies them service. The ride-hailing firm has been using the tool to secure early access to cities where its operations had not yet been authorized. But having defended the system just a few days ago, it has now done a U-turn.\"We are expressly prohibiting its use to target action by local regulators going forward,\" said Uber\'s chief security officer Joe Sullivan. He said the same technology had also been used for many other purposes, including for marketing promotions and deterring Uber riders using the app in violation of the company\'s term of service. These are understood to include stopping users aiming to physically harm drivers and targeting competitors looking to disrupt operations. These uses will not be affected by the ban. Mr Sullivan said that because of the way the system was configured, it would take some time to ensure the prohibition was fully enforced. What is Greyball? Greyball identified regulators posing as ordinary passengers, by collecting data on the location used when ordering a taxi and determining whether this coincided with government offices. found that it also checked credit card information to establish whether the user was linked to an institution or law enforcement authority. Uber, the report added, even visited phone shops to trace smartphones bought by city officials setting up multiple accounts in an effort to catch the company\'s drivers. Once individuals suspected of attempting to entrap drivers were identified, they would be served a \"fake\" version of the Uber app, with fictitious cabs on view.

'India washing machine launched with \'curry\' button A washing machine has been launched for the Indian market, with a special mode to tackle curry stains. Panasonic said the introduction of a \'curry\' button followed complaints from customers struggling to fully get the food off their clothes. It says development took two years, testing combinations of water temperature and water flow. The machine has five other cycles aimed at the Indian consumer, including one to remove traces of hair oil. Wringing the changes As part of the development, Panasonic researchers analysed what went into a typical Indian household\'s curry dish. The firm said it then tried to establish the optimal time and water temperature required to remove the stains. Panasonic said it planned similar machines for other Asian markets, tackling stains specific to those countries, but would not elaborate. Only about 10\% of homes in India have a washing machine, with most people still doing their laundry by hand. That means there is plenty of room for market growth, and the electronics giant hopes the India-focussed machine will help it challenge the South Korean manufacturers dominating the sector. Panasonic told the BBC that about 5, 000 of the machines had been sold so far, with a target to sell at least 30, 000 by March next year. Priced at about 22, 000 Indian rupees (£268;$330), the new model costs around 10\% more than other washing machines.

'Eurovision: Russia rejects offer for Julia Samoilova to perform \'via satellite\' Russia\'s state-controlled television has rejected an offer from organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest to allow their nation\'s contestant to perform via satellite link. Channel One said that the offer for Julia Samoilova to perform in the event in Ukraine remotely was \"strange\". Samoilova has been banned from Ukraine, which hosts this year\'s contest, for entering annexed Crimea via Russia. The Kremlin had called for a rethink of Ukraine\'s decision.\"We consider the offer of remote participation strange and reject it,\" Channel One said in a statement on Thursday , adding: \"It completely contradicts the very essence of the event.\" The offer to perform in the competition via satellite link is a first in Eurovision\'s 60-year-history, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said, adding that the contest had to \"remain free from politics\". Samoilova is due to take part in the second semi-final of the song contest. \'Celebrate diversity\' Jon Ola Sand, executive supervisor of Eurovision, earlier said that organisers were talking to Ukrainian authorities \"with the ambition to have all artists present\" in host city Kiev for May\'s contest. He said: \"It is imperative that the Eurovision Song Contest remains free from politics and as such, due to the circumstances surrounding Julia\'s travel ban, we have felt it important to propose a solution that transcends such issues. Frank-Dieter Freiling, chairman of the governing body of the Eurovision Song Contest, said he hoped Ukraine would not enforce the travel ban and would instead \"find a solution in line with the contest\'s slogan, celebrate diversity\". Who is Julia Samoilova? The singer-songwriter was born in April 1989 in Ukhta, Russia Her song Flame is Burning was composed by Leonid Gutkin, who also produced Russia\'s 2013 and 2015 entries The Russian entrant has been in a wheelchair since childhood, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy: a neuromuscular disorder causing muscle wastage She was a 2013 finalist in Russia\'s X Factor competition and performed at the opening ceremony to the 2014 Sochi Winter Paralympics Samoilova has said she was \"not upset\" by . She told Channel One state-controlled television, which selected her as Russia\'s contestant with her song Flame is Burning, that she did not understand why Ukraine saw \"some kind of threat in a little girl like me\". \"I will keep going.

'Theresa May gives up crisps for Lent Prime Minister Theresa May will refrain from tucking into crisps for Lent, Downing Street has revealed. At the regular press briefing, the PM\'s spokesman said her favourite flavour was salt and vinegar - but stopped short of endorsing a specific brand. He was also unable to tell reporters how often Mrs May tucks into a bag.\"I don\'t know how many packets of crisps the prime minister consumes per week, per day or per month, but she will be giving them up,\" he told them. Christians traditionally give up certain foods over Lent, which leads up to Easter and this year begins on 1 March, to mark Jesus\'s 40 days of fasting in the desert. ',politics
'SXSW 2017: Reddit thinks it can break your echo chamber After the referendums and elections of 2016, concern over online echo chambers grew - the idea that we were getting shielded from a wide range of views because of who we chose to be friends with online. Could offer a solution? At 280 million active monthly users, the link-sharing site is already a phenomenally influential force on the internet. The site allows you to post links that are then either up or down voted by other users. Upvoted content is given more visibility - and potentially millions of hits - and the downvoted stuff falls away and barely gets seen by anyone. As well as the \"front page\" that shows the most popular content, adjusted slightly according to your own tastes, the site also has \"subreddits\", smaller sections devoted to a particular topic. This system makes it the ideal place to discover views different to your own, said co-founder Alexis Ohanian in an interview with the BBC. \"It\'s a community that\'s not defined by social connection,\" he said following a talk at the South by SouthWest (SXSW) Interactive festival in Austin, Texas.\"What we hope we can do, because these communities are all there, is expose people to those different Zeitgeists. \"This is the first time you can actually go and see how these disparate groups are feeling and thinking about anything, any time of day.\"Trump fans There\'s perhaps no better example of this than r/The_Donald. The subreddit has become the leading online hub for President Trump\'s supporters - the man himself held a Q+A session there last year. It\'s a noisy collection of insider-jargon, conspiracy theories and cries of \"fake news\" - but it\'s also the best place to assess what makes Trump\'s fans tick.\"I think it illustrates well that there are communities on Reddit that maybe I personally don\'t really agree with,\" said Mr Ohanian.\"But they\'re perspectives that, as long as they\'re within the lines of our content policy, are worth having.\"Many Reddit users - not just Trump fans - were outraged last year when it emerged Steve Huffman, the other Reddit co-founder and its current chief executive, . While apologising, Mr Huffman also announced new measures to curb some of the tactics used by members of r/The_Donald to \"game\" Reddit - that is, artificially make posts appear more prominently to other users. Mr Ohanian said such actions were frustrating, but were ultimately helping the site develop.\"A lot of this ends up pressure-testing a lot of the things we\'re going to need to have built anyway in the years to come as we keep growing. We have a user base that\'s really keen on pressure testing a lot of this.\"He added that he felt the influence of r/The_Donald had been overblown.\"It is not nearly as big as people perceive it to be. Statistically it\'s actually pretty small, relative to other communities on Reddit.\"Into the \'real world\' Looking to the future, Mr Ohanian told the BBC it plans to move into more \"traditional\" platforms in order to attract the new audiences it needs to grow.\"People are consuming content on one big screen in their home,\" he said.\"If we can work with partners who reach those big audiences on those big screens, and bringing people back to Reddit, and we on Reddit are pushing people to that content, we want to create this virtuous cycle that brings awareness of Reddit and the rich conversations that happen there to the audience that\'s just watching the big screens, not paying attention.\"He wouldn\'t say it directly, but the company will soon be announcing partnerships with TV companies - \"high-quality\" and \"traditional\" \"content partners\" - to integrate Reddit chatter into top shows. This will undoubtedly bring new users to the platform, but for a site that has managed to maintain its distinct tone and sense of humour, some users will be concerned that a flood people could spoil things.\"I hear where you\'re coming from,\" he said. \"Reddit has this amazing ability to still feel small. And that\'s great. But it\'s really, really big. Sure there maybe concerns - but Reddit has been absorbing tens of millions of new users all the time, and these communities still proliferate, and still feel small.\"',tech
'Championship: Jersey Reds 15-11 London Irish London Irish suffered their first league loss of the season, as Jersey celebrated one of the club\'s greatest-ever results. Scott Steele\'s try put the Exiles ahead but Jersey winger Nick Scott touched down as the sides were level at 8-8 by half-time. Irish had won all 17 of their Championship games and led narrowly going into the closing stages. But Gary Graham\'s late try from close range was enough for the Jersey win. The victory was their ninth in a row and, though they remain fifth, it boosts their chances of sneaking into the play-offs. Scrum-half Steele had opened the scoring just before the 15-minute mark after a series of pick-and-goes near the line, but Jersey were level when winger Scott was found by Joel Dudley in space out wide on the left. Former Saracens full-back Ben Ransom calmly slotted over a drop-goal to edge London Irish back ahead but Callum Sheedy\'s penalty made it all square at the break. Jersey knew they would be playing against a strong wind in the second period against a side used to winning and backed by about 1, 000 travelling supporters in the biggest-ever crowd for a Championship fixture at St Peter of 3, 317. London Irish centre Theo Brophy Clews knocked over a penalty to re-establish a narrow advantage before the hosts found a new gear, pushing for a winning try which came when flanker Graham powered over with 77 minutes showing on the clock in the ground. Sheedy\'s conversion put the Reds more than a penalty ahead, before late Irish pressure which Jersey just about withstood to claim a memorable victory. London Irish are already guaranteed to finish top of the Championship table, while the islanders remain in fifth spot with just two games against play-off rivals Doncaster and bottom side Richmond to come. The teams meet again in eight days\' time at the Madejski Stadium in the semi-finals of the British and Irish Cup. \"To beat a team like that, for them to come here unbeaten and we\'re on a good bit of form, it\'s just a massive step in the right direction for us in our play-off campaign.\"There were some crucial points in the game where we were grinding it out and showing what we can do so it was huge.\"The atmosphere here today was absolutely fantastic and if we can replicate that in the coming home games it would be fantastic.\" Cuthbert; Adair, Davies, Ma\'afu, Scott; Sheedy, Dudley; Woolmore, Buckle, Kerrod, Phillips, McKern, Freeman (capt), Graham, Haining.

'How the Instant Pot cooker developed a cult following Robert Wang was hoping to make it easier for people to make a decent meal, but didn\'t expect his new product to attract a cult following. Last summer on Amazon Prime Day, the online retailer\'s global 24-hour annual sale event, one of the top-selling products in the US was a multi-function electric cooker. The item in question is called the Instant Pot, and more than 215, 000 of them were snapped up in the US on that single day. The fact that this countertop appliance was outselling TVs and tablets may come as a surprise to many people, but not to its legions of dedicated fans, who express unabashed adoration.\"If you look at the Amazon reviews, one common word is \'love\',\" says Mr Wang. \"Americans are very open with their emotions. Love is all over the place. Another one is that \'Instant Pot changed my life\'.\"That\'s actually rewarding to us - understanding that we have created value for society.\" First available to buy in 2010, the Instant Pot has become a veritable craze, a success built through social media word-of-mouth instead of traditional TV or print advertising. Today, the official Instant Pot Facebook group is nearly 398, 000-people strong, and there are thousands of other online enthusiasts. Fans share recipes online and tips for making everything from soups, stews and chilli, to poached eggs, popcorn and cheesecake in the appliance. Mr Wang says that from the beginning the intention was to let the product speak for itself, and build up sales thanks to customer recommendations rather than pay for advertising. He describes this as the \"build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door\" marketing strategy. All-in-one The Instant Pot is the brainchild of Mr Wang and his friend Yi Qin, who are both veterans of the Canadian technology sector. Mr Wang had worked for the now-defunct telecoms group Nortel, while Mr Qin had been employed by Blackberry. They were brainstorming ideas for a new project in 2008 and realised people were searching for the same solution they were - a way to cook healthy meals for a family quickly and affordably. That was when their attention turned to kitchen appliances and rebooting the pressure cooker. They came up with the idea for the Instant Pot, which is a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, saute pan, yogurt maker, warming pot all-in-one unit. Together with three other partners, they set up a business called Double Insight in Ottawa, the Canadian capital, and the first version of Instant Pot was born in 2010.\"We have tried to automate cooking as much as possible and tried to simplify the cooker,\" says Mr Qin, who is the firm\'s vice president of product management. \"One press of the button can cook the meal for the family.\" The product was, however, not an immediate success. Mr Qin says that one problem was the \"stigma\" surrounding one of the Instant Pot\'s main functions: the fact that it can be used as a pressure cooker, which had long since fallen out of favour in North American kitchens.\"Most people have some concept of urban legends of exploding pressure cookers in their grandmother\'s kitchens,\" says Mr Qin. He says they addressed the issue by making product safety a design priority, and making the Instant Pot as foolproof to use as possible. Thanks to word of mouth, sales were growing well by 2013 when Amazon started to sell the product, and sales shot up further.\"Amazon is a very practical company,\" says Mr Qin. \"They didn\'t approach us until they saw that the [upward sales] trend had already formed.\" \'Tell three friends\' The online buzz surrounding the Instant Pot has been helped by food bloggers enthusiastically talking about the product, and sharing recipes, with their followers. Some of these bloggers buy their own Instant Pot, while Double Insight gives the cookers to others to test out. Laura Pazzaglia, from website Hip Pressure Cooking, says that she is not surprised by the gadget\'s success.\"Everybody who has an Instant Pot, they tell three friends about it,\" she says. \"If you keep going like that, obviously you can\'t help but succeed.\"Today Double Insight remains a small business with just 25 employees, contracting out the manufacture of the product to a factory in China. While the Instant Pot is facing increasing competition from rival products made by much larger appliance companies such as Breville and Black &amp; Decker, Ms Pazzaglia says that Instant Pot\'s early start and vast online following gives it an edge. Zeynep Arsel, associate professor of marketing at Montreal\'s Concordia University, says that the Instant Pot resonates with the trend towards healthy but uncomplicated food, and is boosted by \"a textbook perfect buzz marketing campaign\". She adds: \"Cooking is a social and emotional practice that creates a lot of meaning in our lives.\"So a product that takes centre stage in cooking practices also creates a sense of attachment by being an agent in our social and emotional lives.\" With the Instant Pot now on to its fourth iteration, its design development has been led by feedback and ideas submitted by users. With prices starting from $80 (£65) for the most basic model, the top-of-the-range $180 version can be controlled remotely via your mobile phone.\"This is not so much an Instant Pot story per se, this is every user\'s story,\" says Mr Qin. \"Whenever you have an Instant Pot product, you have a story to tell.\" ',business

'London Mayor Sadiq Khan \'not accusing SNP of being racists\' London Mayor Sadiq Khan has insisted that a trail of his address to the Scottish Labour conference in Perth was not accusing the SNP of being racists. Part of his speech - posted on Twitter - implied there was \"no difference\" between nationalism and racism. The tweeted extract prompted a strong response on social media including from Nicola Sturgeon. Scotland\'s first minister described Mr Khan\'s intervention as \"spectacularly ill-judged\". Using her Twitter handle, she said: \"It is an insult to all those Scots who support independence for reasons of inclusion &amp; social justice - the antithesis of what he says.\" Before taking to the conference stage, Mr Khan told BBC Scotland\'s political editor Brian Taylor \"of course I am not saying that the SNP are racists or bigots\".

But the government was criticised last year for its support of the UK tech scene. As part of the new digital strategy, computer scientist Prof Dame Wendy Hall and tech CEO Jerome Pesenti, former chief data scientist at IBM, have been asked to review the UK\'s artificial intelligence sector. \"Our scientists, researchers and entrepreneurs are at the forefront of the development of artificial intelligence and I\'m looking forward to exploring how industry and government can work together to support the technology in the UK,\" said Dame Wendy.

'Scotland 1-1 Canada: Poor start affected Scots - Gordon Strachan Manager Gordon Strachan felt Scotland struggled to recover from their poor start in with Canada. The visitors led through Fraser Aird\'s strike after 11 minutes, with Steven Naismith levelling before the break.\"Because of our first 15 minutes, giving the ball away, I thought we got a bit negative,\" Strachan told BBC Radio Scotland\'s Sportsound. \"That\'s what happens when players don\'t play regularly. We could\'ve trusted each other better with the ball.\"The Scots host Slovenia on Sunday in their fifth World Cup qualifier, with the visitors four points ahead of second-bottom Scotland. And Strachan was glad to have had the friendly with Canada at Easter Road, despite only being able to draw with the side ranked 117th in the world. Fulham midfielder Tom Cairney - who has scored nine goals in 41 appearances at club level this season - was given his international debut and it was from his shot that Naismith diverted the ball over the line to draw Scotland level. Ikechi Anya, who has just one substitute appearance at club level in March, again started at right-back, where he played in the November defeat by England, while RB Leipzig\'s Oliver Burke started wide on the left after three substitute appearances in the Bundesliga this month. Burke and Rangers captain Lee Wallace were withdrawn at half-time, the latter at fault for Canada\'s goal, and Barry Bannan and Andy Robertson, regulars for Sheffield Wednesday and Hull City, came on. Christophe Berra and Charlie Mulgrew formed a new central defensive pairing but were stretched at times, particularly by the running of Falkirk winger Aird.\"It\'s one of the best decisions we\'ve made as the coaching group in the SFA by playing this game,\" Strachan added.\"We found out so many things tonight. It\'s very hard for players who are not playing regularly to turn on the magic and feel really good about themselves. \"So, we learned that lesson, the lesson that you really can\'t mis-pass the ball so many times in the first 10 minutes and expect to then go and play really that well because you lose a bit of confidence. \"When you\'re not playing regularly, you lose that couple of yards\' pace, you lose that wee touch, you lose that finishing that you would normally have. That\'s what happened to us tonight.\"It\'s very hard. It\'s like asking a top golfer to be out for six, seven weeks and go and try and play in the Masters.\"Tom did all right in his first game. Kech [Anya] kept us going, Barry did well when he came on. Charlie Mulgrew was comfortable, Christophe Berra was comfortable doing what he does well - man-marking. Andrew played very well when he came on as well.\"It helps us make sure we have to pick a bunch of lads, a group of lads who are feeling really good about themselves at the moment. Has it made my mind up with one or two things? Yes, it has, yeah.\"And Anya said: \"It was a good exercise. For a few of us who haven\'t been playing for our club sides that regularly, it was a worthwhile exercise against a good opposition.\"The game was put on for a purpose and it served that purpose, let us speak after the game on Sunday, that\'s the most important.\"',sport
'Charlotte Hogg resigns as Bank of England deputy governor Charlotte Hogg, who was set to become a Bank of England deputy governor, has resigned after failing to disclose her brother worked at Barclays. Ms Hogg broke the Bank\'s code of conduct by failing to reveal the potential conflict of interest. She had been the Bank\'s chief operating officer since 2013. But news of her brother\'s job only emerged earlier this month, when she faced MPs on the Treasury Committee about her promotion to deputy governor. She would have had responsibility for markets and banking. Her brother Quintin works in the strategy unit of Barclays\' investment bank. A Treasury Committee report released on Tuesday said she \"fell short of the very high standards\" required and that MPs had \"set aside\" its approval of her appointment. Minutes after the committee released its report, the Bank announced Ms Hogg\'s resignation. She will not leave immediately and therefore will take part in this week\'s Monetary Policy Committee meeting. It will be the first - and last - time Ms Hogg is involved with the MPC, which sets UK interest rates. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, economics editor The Treasury Committee\'s action against Charlotte Hogg is certainly significant. And its significance goes well beyond the future of Ms Hogg. Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, backed her until one minute to midnight. Which, after the evidence laid out by the committee today, is likely to be questioned by MPs when Mr Carney next appears before them.\'Honest mistake\' \"While I fully respect her decision, taken in accordance with her view of what was the best for this institution, I deeply regret that Charlotte Hogg has chosen to resign from the Bank of England.\"We will do everything we can to honour her work for the people of the United Kingdom by building on her contributions.\" Ms Hogg said she was very sorry for failing to disclose her brother\'s role. She also said she had offered to resign last week.\"It was an honest mistake: I have made no secret of my brother\'s job - indeed it was I who informed the Treasury Select Committee of it, before my hearing. \"But I fully accept it was a mistake, made worse by the fact that my involvement in drafting the policy made it incumbent on me to get all my own declarations absolutely right,\" Ms Hogg said.\"I also, in the course of a long hearing, unintentionally misled the committee as to whether I had filed my brother\'s job on the correct forms at the Bank.\"I would like to repeat my apologies for that, and to make clear that the responsibility for all those errors is mine alone.\"The Bank is planning to tighten up its governance of the code of conduct. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, said: \"This is a regrettable business with no winners. Ms Hogg has acted in the best interest of the institution for which she has been working. This is welcome. \"It is also welcome that the Bank has responded immediately by announcing an internal review. \"The Bank\'s governance is already in much better shape than it was a few years ago. It is something to which the Governor and Court has been committed for some time. But there is clearly more to do.\" John Mann, an MP on the Treasury Committee, told it was \"appropriate\" she had resigned.\"She wrote the code of conduct for the Bank of England which says: \'Do you have a family member working in the banking industry, ie a brother or sister?\'\"It\'s an explicit set of standards that she wrote and didn\'t comply with and that made her position totally untenable.\"The question for Mark Carney is why the set of standards wasn\'t being adhered to. He needs to be very clear now on what the Bank\'s going to do to address this. It\'s clearly a systemic issue in the Bank.\" ',business

The developer needs to agree with ministers how much subsidy it should receive for the energy generated. Tidal Lagoon Power would also need a marine licence to be approved.

'Nintendo Switch cartridges \'taste so bad\' Cartridges for the Nintendo Switch console taste foul because of a \"bittering agent\" intended to prevent them from being accidentally swallowed.

'How one woman beat her mental illness by helping others Jessica May was moving quickly up the career ladder until she was tripped up by mental illness. Following the birth of her first child, Jessica developed a problem with her thyroid gland that greatly exacerbated her pre-existing anxiety disorder.\"I\'ve had anxiety my whole life,\" says the 36-year-old from Canberra, Australia. \"The [thyroid] condition meant that my anxiety got out of control.\"This was back in 2012, and Jessica decided to return to her civil service job sooner than originally planned, after she and her doctor agreed that getting back to doing the work she loved would keep her focused and hopefully mitigate her anxiety. But Jessica, who had to reveal her mental health problem to her employers to receive the flexible schedule she needed, claims that her managers and colleagues started to make negative assumptions about her capabilities, and began to exclude her from projects. \"Because of how I was treated... I didn\'t really get better,\" she says. Having previously managed 17 staff, Jessica says she felt disheartened and devalued. However, the bad experience did ultimately have a positive impact - it made Jessica determined to help other people with mental or physical disabilities, and gave her the idea for setting up a business to do this.\"I knew there needed to be something for people with disabilities who just need a little bit of flexibility from their employers,\" she says. So she decided to quit her government job and launch Enabled Employment, a recruitment consultancy that helps people with a disability find paid work. Today, the Canberra-based company helps thousands of people find work at more than 400 businesses in Australia, including accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, taxi hire service Uber, and even the Australian Defence Force. To help get Enabled up and running, Jessica successfully applied for a small entrepreneurship grant from the Australian Capital Territory government. She left her civil service job one Friday in December 2012, and started work at Enabled the following Monday, with help and support coming from a local start-up support initiative called the Griffin Accelerator. The number of people and companies using the business then slowly started to grow. The business is similar to a regular recruitment agency, in that it maintains an online listing of available jobs, and acts as a mediator between would-be employees and hiring managers. However, Enabled also offers what it calls \"accessibility brokering\", which means that it works to ensure that businesses are able to offer employees the working conditions they need to perform at their best. This includes checking on flexible working hours and ensuring that offices have disabled access and toilets. Jessica is keen to stress that the company is not a charity. Instead it is a for-profit business. She believes that charities that pay businesses to take on disabled staff can reinforce negative stereotypes about disabled people. \"It really devalues people with disabilities who are totally capable,\" she says. \"We don\'t want anyone to feel like a charity case.\"Instead, Enabled charges companies, typically a one-off fee equivalent to 10\% of a person\'s annual salary. By contrast, people who use Enabled to find work don\'t have to pay it anything. \"There\'s 4. 2 million people in Australia with a disability. Many of these people are very competent, it is really about trying to break down their barriers to work,\" says Jessica.\"We charge businesses for our services because you should be paying for amazingly qualified people, and you should also be paying for the diversity that it brings.\"Enabled is valued at more than six million Australian dollars ($4. 6m; £3. 9m), and has expanded its services to include military veterans and indigenous Australians. Suzanne Colbert, the founder of the Australian Network on Disability, says that Enabled has \"freshened up\" the Australian job market\'s otherwise \"stale\" attitude towards hiring people with disabilities. She adds that Enabled has allowed employers to \"tap into new sources of talent\". When it comes to its own staff, Enabled practises what it preaches. Four of its seven full-time employees have a disability and work within a schedule that accommodates them best. The company and Jessica have also won a number of Australian awards, including start-up of the year in 2015, and a National Disability Award for community accessibility. Looking ahead, Jessica says she plans to expand the business in Australia before considering any moves overseas. But for now, she says she is \"the happiest she\'s ever been\".\"I still have anxiety. It doesn\'t ever go away, but I can definitely manage it with the flexibility that we have at Enabled.\"',business
'Stormzy criticises \'foul\' NME over mental health cover Stormzy has criticised NME for putting him on its cover without permission for a story about depression.

'Ann Clwyd autobiography: \'No regrets\' for Iraq war support A veteran MP has said she still has no regrets about her support for the second Iraq war. Ann Clwyd, who has been Labour MP for Cynon Valley for 33 years, said her argument in favour of action was about human rights rather than weapons of mass destruction. She added her frequent visits to Iraq made her fear for her safety. Ms Clwyd was speaking to BBC Radio Wales ahead of the publication of her autobiography, Rebel With a Cause.\"Some of my best friends in the House of Commons were on the left of the Labour Party and they were opposed to the war but yet they followed my argument that for me it was about human rights,\" she told . She said her three decades in Parliament had been dominated by human rights issues, especially those in support of Kurds in Iraq.\"I absolutely knew nothing at all about those [weapons of mass destruction],\" she said.\"I was there in February 2003 just before the start of the war and for the first time ever the Kurds said to me there\'s no other way - meaning that they needed outside help.\"We helped them re-build civic society, trained them to stand in elections. I went to the first election they had after Saddam and I know what we did and the Americans did as well to try and re-build the Iraqi society.\"\'Frightening\' She said she flew to Iraq about 25 times after the war.\"We didn\'t know quite when the flights were leaving Kuwait,\" added Ms Clwyd. \"We had to be ready to go and fly in the dark and then they had to manoeuvre the plane quite often because there were ground to surface missiles being used and we knew that some of the manoeuvres were to avoid what they thought was danger on the ground.\"There were a few occasions like that which you know were frightening, but I suppose I\'ve always been keen on adventure.\"Ms Clwyd, who criticises Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, also said she did not regret changing her mind about after previously saying she would stand down. She added Mr Corbyn still deserved loyalty.\"I chaired the Parliamentary party and I know there were always an element that want to get rid of the party leader, and I can\'t tell you how many times that has happened while I actually was in the chair,\" she said.\"That person is elected as party leader and we have to back that person... Jeremy Corbyn is the leader, and he has to have our loyalty.\"',politics
'Premier League gets Kodi piracy court order The Premier League has secured a court order to help tackle rights-infringing video streams of football matches via so-called Kodi set-top boxes. The order gives the league the means to have computer servers used to power the streams blocked. Until now, it could only go after individual video streams which were relatively easy to re-establish at different links. A spokesman said it could now target pirates in a \"precise manner\".\"For the first time this will enable the Premier League to disrupt and prevent the illegal streaming of our matches via IPTV, so-called Kodi, boxes,\" he added. Football fans are urged instead to get a Sky Sports or BT Sport subscription, or watch games at a venue that pays for access.\'Pirating epidemic\' The Federation Against Copyright Theft (Fact) declared that the use of Kodi software to watch pirated streams was becoming an \"epidemic\" last September. Since then, there have been several arrests of people selling set-top boxes pre-installed with both Kodi software and additional third-party add-ons that make it possible to watch copyright-infringing film and TV streams. According to a recent survey commissioned by the security firm Irdeto, Kodi boxes are particularly prevalent in the UK. It reported that 11\% of Brits that admitted to watching pirated streams in a survey said they did so via a Kodi box. There is confusion about whether doing so is illegal. Derbyshire County Council trading users would not break copyright laws by doing so.\"Accessing premium paid-for content without a subscription is considered by the industry as unlawful access, although streaming something online, rather than downloading a file, is likely to be exempt from copyright laws,\" they said. But the Intellectual Property Office has taken a different view.\"It is a criminal offence to knowingly receive subscription broadcasts without paying for them, and there are also provisions restricting the manufacture, sale or use of equipment designed to circumvent the encryption that protects many TV broadcasts,\" said Matt Cope, deputy director of intellectual property enforcement. What are Kodi boxes? Kodi is free software, built by volunteers, that is designed to bring videos, music, games and photographs together in one easy-to-use application. Some shops sell set-top boxes and TV sticks known as Kodi boxes, preloaded with the software. The developers behind Kodi say their software does not contain any content of its own and is designed to play legally owned media or content \"freely available\" on the internet. However, the software can be modified with third-party add-ons that provide access to pirated copies of films and TV series, or provide free access to subscription television channels.\"Streaming boxes have steadily increased in popularity in recent years,\" said Ernesto van der Sar, from the news site .\"Most use the entirely legal Kodi software, but some are augmented with illegal third-party add-ons. \"Nowadays people often prefer to stream pirated content instead of using traditional torrent sites.\"',tech
'Marcus Rashford: Manchester United striker to be called up to England senior squad Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford will be named in Gareth Southgate\'s England squad on Thursday. The 19-year-old was initially expected to feature for the England Under-21 side in friendlies against Germany and Denmark next weekend. But with England forwards Harry Kane and Wayne Rooney both ruled out through injury, Rashford will be called up. England face Germany away in a friendly before a World Cup qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on 26 March. Rashford made a goal-scoring debut for England in a 2-1 win over Australia in May last year and has collected six senior caps. He was a late inclusion for Manchester United in their on Monday, having been omitted from the initial squad due to illness. England captain Rooney was ruled out of Manchester United\'s trip to the capital with a leg injury sustained in a training ground collision. And went off with an ankle injury against Millwall on Sunday. Spurs said the injury is similar to the one Kane picked up against Sunderland on 18 September.',sport
'What a £1 coin could have made since 1983 Investing a £1 coin when it entered circulation in 1983 could have seen its real value grow more than tenfold, according to an investment firm. The current £1 coin will be discontinued this year, as a 12-sided coin enters circulation on 28 March. Asset manager M&amp; G has calculated that, if left in a piggy bank, inflation since 1983 would have corroded its buying power to the equivalent of 32p. Investing in shares would brought a much higher return, it said. If the £1 had been invested in shares in 1983 and tracked the rise in the FTSE all-share index, it would have had a value of £11. 66 by the end of 2016, after allowing for inflation. This would have required any income to be reinvested each month - to make the most of compounding over time. Ritu Vohora, investment director at M&amp; G, said that the replacement of the old round pound coin was a \"timely reminder\" of the corrosive effects of inflation - the rising cost of living. Any investment carries a risk of losing money, unlike saving, but Ms Vohora argued that there were potential rewards.\"Our analysis shows that you can turn even a modest investment into a healthy pot of money if you are willing to accept an element of risk and are in a position to make a long-term investment,\" she said. This investment in shares would outstrip investing in gold, which would have had a real value of £1. 05 by the end of 2016, and a cash savings account (real value of £1. 33). However, the appeal of shares over cash was challenged by Susan Hannums, director at independent savings advice site Savingschampion. co. uk.\"For some people, cash is the most appropriate asset to hold, certainly for some of their money, but it should still be looked after properly to make sure that it works as hard as possible,\" she said. \"The secret to making sure that cash is not a wasted asset, is to keep switching in order to ensure it is earning the best rates of interest possible. This can prove invaluable.\"The M&amp; G calculations suggest that investing one pound in government bonds would have seen it grow to a real value of £4. 93 by the end of 2016. Putting the money in UK residential property would have seen the real value grow to £2. 42 over the same period, M&amp; G said. However, this only measured the growth in value of property which, unlike shares, could not be reinvested each month, so this comparison is questionable. ',business

'Downing Street rejects Hague call for snap election Downing Street has rejected former Conservative leader Lord Hague\'s call to hold a snap general election., Lord Hague said bringing forward an election \"would strengthen the government\'s hand at home and abroad\" which could help with Brexit negotiations. A No 10 source told the BBC it was not something Prime Minister Theresa May \"plans to do or wishes to do\". Jeremy Corbyn said Labour was ready to take its case to the country. The next election is due in May 2020 under the . Lord Hague suggested repealing the legislation, which was brought in by the coalition government, but acknowledged an imminent election was unlikely. Lord Hague said the government faced \"the most complex challenges of modern times\". These included \"Brexit negotiations, the Trump administration, the threat from Scottish nationalists, and many other issues\". A snap election \"would catch the Labour Party in its worst condition since the early 30s, and with its least credible leader ever\". \"There is no doubt that they (the prime minister and cabinet) would be in a stronger position to take the country through these challenges successfully if they had a large and decisive majority in the Commons and a new full term ahead of them,\" he said.\"Any [Brexit] deal is bound to be full of compromises which one group or another in Parliament finds difficult to stomach. Theresa May has a reputation around Whitehall for following the evidence. Ministers who might not automatically see themselves as her bosom political buddies report that she gives \"a fair hearing\" and \"you can really influence her decisions\" if arguments and information are rationally debated and presented. That formal style irritates some and raises accusations that it is impossible to deal with the Number 10 \"bottleneck\". But it has, in some quarters, won her grudging respect. On one particular issue, however, even some of her supporters believe she is not following the natural logic. That\'s her decision, so far, not to take people like Lord Hague\'s now very public advice and call an early election.\"As British law needs to be amended countless times to take account of leaving the EU treaties, the government could face many close votes, concessions or defeats as it tries to implement Brexit.\"That prospect will embolden the EU negotiators, and makes an agreement that is good for the UK harder to achieve.\"It could also lead to a situation where the prime minister faces a stand-off with Parliament over a deal that will have taken two years to negotiate and is nearly impossible to change.\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party had supported the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, but that it would \"consider\" any change to get rid of it.

'Plusnet fined £880, 000 for billing former customers Plusnet, an internet service provider owned by BT, has been fined £880, 000 for wrongly billing more than 1, 000 former customers. An investigation by watchdog Ofcom found that the ISP broke a fundamental billing rule by continuing to charge a group of customers for landline and broadband after they had cancelled services. In total, customers were overcharged by more than £500, 000. Plusnet has apologised for the error. Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom\'s consumer group director, said: \"There can be no margin for error, and no excuses, when it comes to billing customers correctly. \"This fine should serve as a reminder to telecoms companies that they must adhere to Ofcom\'s billing rules at all times, or face the consequences.\"A spokeswoman for the ISP said: \"We are very sorry and would like to apologise to the 1, 025 customers affected. We reported this ourselves to Ofcom and made every effort to contact these customers to arrange a full refund before the investigation started.\"We would also like to reassure all customers this was an isolated historic issue and we have implemented a number of new robust measures to make sure this doesn\'t happen again.\"Plusnet has made repeated attempts to refund all affected ex-customers by letter and phone.

'Team Sky: Doctor has no records of \'mystery package\' for Sir Bradley Wiggins A doctor who received a \'mystery package\' for Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2011 has no record of his medical treatment at the time, MPs have heard. In 2014, ex-Team Sky medic Dr Richard Freeman had a laptop containing medical records stolen, the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee were told. Team Sky and British Cycling\'s record-keeping was questioned in the hearing. \"No one has any recognition of what was in the package,\" UK Anti-Doping chief Nicole Sapstead said on Wednesday. The select committee is conducting an inquiry entitled \'Combatting doping in sport\', while Ukad has been carrying out its own investigation into the contents of the jiffy bag package. Referring to Team Sky\'s incomplete records, Sapstead described it as \"odd\", adding that she thought a team founded on the premise of racing cleanly would have evidence \"to demonstrate any inferences to the contrary\". Committee chairman Damian Collins MP said after the hearing that the \"credibility of Team Sky and British Cycling is in tatters\". He added: \"How can you say British Cycling is the cleanest and most ethical in the world when there are no records to substantiate what the doctors are giving the cyclists?\"Collins told BBC Sport the hearing had been \"a damning indictment of the way things have been run\" at both organisations. Dr Freeman, who received the package from then-British Cycling coach Simon Cope on the final day of the Criterium du Dauphine in France in 2011, missed the hearing because of ill health. Cope described himself as a \"gap filler\" for British Cycling and Team Sky and told MPs he did not ask what was in the package. In December, Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford told the committee that Freeman had said the package contained an over-the-counter decongestant, But Sapstead said Ukad still does not know for sure if Fluimucil was in the package because there is no paperwork.\"We have asked for inventories and medical records and we have not been able to ascertain that because there are no records,\" she said. What do Team Sky and British Cycling say? Team Sky said they had \"co-operated fully\" with Ukad\'s investigation and denied any wrongdoing.\"Team Sky is a clean team,\" the statement said. \"We abide by the rules and we are proud of our stance against doping. \"We believe our approach to anti-doping is rigorous and comprehensive.\"British Cycling, meanwhile, acknowledged \"serious failings in our record-keeping at the time\" but said they would review and make changes to their processes.\"We are wholly committed to clean sport and I want to assure athletes, fans and all other stakeholders that this commitment is unwavering,\" said British Cycling chair Jonathan Browning. \"It is not enough to just be clean, we must also be able to demonstrate that we are clean.\" Key points from Wednesday\'s hearing Cope said he had no reason to be believe there was anything \"untoward\" in the package He said he does not believe there is any cheating in British cycling Asked if he felt \"stitched up\" and \"left to dangle\" because of the ongoing inquiry, Cope said \"yes\". Sapstead said a UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) inquiry had been hampered by incomplete or non-existent records She said: \"Team Sky did have a policy of keeping records, just not everyone was adhering to it\" Freeman could potentially face investigation by the General Medical Council for his poor record-keeping Wiggins said he was treated with Fluimucil but was unaware of the jiffy bag contents Orders of the anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone were enough for more than one cyclist There was no evidence of a cover-up or tampering of evidence, said Sapstead Analysis It is the team which championed its use of marginal gains. But Team Sky, together with British Cycling, are now embroiled in a monumental mess. The evidence provided by Nicole Sapstead, and in a different way by Simon Cope, has damaged the reputations of both organisations which have preached a commitment to keeping cycling drug-free in recent years. The lack of effective auditing and the claimed \"resistance\" to investigators are problematic enough. What will require a more rapid response is the assertion by Sapstead that records show British Cycling\'s medical store held a significant amount of triamcinolone, with suggestions it was being used by more than one rider. Finding answers to that however would require access to every rider\'s medical files - a problem given the overriding requirements for doctor/patient confidentiality. The implications of this long-running and ongoing affair could therefore be wide ranging. What did anti-doping chief tell committee? Sapstead said Ukad has interviewed 34 current and former riders and staff members at British Cycling and Team Sky in an investigation that has taken up more than 1, 000 man hours. She described the confusion of how Freeman, who was effectively working for both British Cycling and its road racing off-shoot Team Sky, ordered and stored medicine for riders at the governing body\'s Manchester headquarters, with no clear separation between which drug was for which outfit.\"It\'s very clear from our investigation that there is no audit trail of what is going in and out of a comprehensive supply of medical products,\" she said. Sapstead was asked why Dr Freeman could not produce any evidence.\"He kept medical records on a laptop and, according to Team Sky policy, was meant to upload those records to a dropbox that the other team doctors had access to,\" she said.\"But he didn\'t do that, for whatever reason, and in 2014 his laptop was stolen while he was on holiday in Greece.\"Sapstead said Ukad contacted Interpol to check if this theft was reported at the time but has not received any confirmation it was, although Freeman did report it to British Cycling. What did courier tell committee? Cope said he was asked by his then-boss Shane Sutton to pick up a package from the National Cycling Centre in Manchester on 8 June, 2011 and take it out to French ski resort La Toussuire, where the Dauphine [won by Wiggins] finished on 12 June. He told MPs he considered this to be a routine request and common in cycling. Questioned on why he did not ask what was in the package, he said: \"Why would I question it? Why would I question the integrity of our governing body? I just didn\'t ask. You may think I\'m stupid.\"It must have been something medical, because it was for Dr Freeman, but I had no reason to doubt it. Throughout my career, I\'ve looked up to our governing body. We\'ve done so well and with a zero-tolerance stance [on doping].\"When pointed to the fact he was taking medical products overseas, Cope - who now manages Wiggins\' professional road-racing team - said: \"I probably should have asked what was in the package but the other day I travelled down to Spain with 40 boxes in the car. I didn\'t check every box, but I presume they were helmets.\"Cope was asked to explain a discrepancy between his recollection of his movements that week and the expense claim he submitted to British Cycling.\"I might have been trying to fiddle them. We all do that, don\'t we?\" he said. How did we get here? Wiggins is a five-time Olympic gold medallist and in 2012 became the first Briton to win the Tour de France. He and Team Sky boss Brailsford have come under scrutiny since information on the rider\'s authorised use of banned drugs to treat a medical condition was released by hackers. Wiggins, an asthma and allergy sufferer, received special permission to use triamcinolone shortly before the 2012 Tour as well as the previous year\'s event and the 2013 Giro d\'Italia. His TUEs were approved by British authorities, and cycling\'s world governing body the UCI. There is no suggestion either the 36-year-old or Team Sky broke any rules. What the papers said ',sport
'Low UK interest rates \'hurt productivity but saved jobs\' Years of ultra-low UK interest rates probably hit productivity, but were a price worth paying to avoid higher unemployment, the Bank of England\'s chief economist has said. Andy Haldane said low rates kept some \"zombie\" firms alive, but the trade off was far more people stayed in work. A Bank modelling scenario found that years of 0. 25\% rates probably kept 1. 5 million in jobs, he said in a speech. He would not have sacrificed those jobs for an extra 1\% or 2\% productivity. Mr Haldane was speaking at the London School of Economics about the \"puzzles of productivity\" and why it has been so low since the financial crisis. On one measure, Mr Haldane said, total factor productivity had shown its longest stagnation in more than 200 years. Low interest rates had probably played a role by keeping some heavily indebted, unproductive \"zombie\" businesses alive, he said. If the Bank had held rates at 4. 25\% since the 2008 financial crisis rather than cut them to record lows, productivity was likely to have been 1\% to 3\% higher. However, holding rates would have imposed a \"very significant macroeconomic cost\" for unemployment, Mr Haldane said. Mentoring \"Should monetary policymakers have sacrificed 1. 5 million jobs for the sake of an extra 1\% or 2\% of productivity? Hand on heart, I can tell you this one would not knowingly have done so,\" the economist said. Options other than higher rates offered a better way to boost productivity. A focus on exports and foreign ownership of companies tended to boost productivity, he said. Mr Haldane pointed to a very wide divergence between Britain\'s most productive and least productive businesses, even within the same sectors and regions. One solution could be a sort of mentoring scheme between what he called \"frontier\" firms and \"non-frontier\" ones so that they could share best practice, he suggested.\"What would be in it for frontier companies? A more productive supply chain is clearly in their interests. The public sector could also play a useful nudging role in its procurement practices,\" Mr Haldane said in his speech.\"By shining a light on companies\' relative performance, the aim is that this would serve as a catalyst for remedial action by company management. Indeed, the aim is to provide firms not only with a means of benchmarking themselves, but with tools to improve performance along identified areas.\"There would be no quick fix, he concluded, but said business could learn from sport on the importance of marginal gains in the quest to improve and succeed.\"As Olympic athletes have shown, marginal improvements accumulated over time can deliver world-beating performance. Applying those marginal gains to the population of UK companies could significantly improve UK living standards, even if those are harder to measure than gold medals,\" Mr Haldane said.',business
'Laura Marling: \'I\'m unsure of my femininity\' Laura Marling\'s latest album was recorded in her adopted home of Los Angeles, so coming back to London to promote it in mid-February has been something of a rude awakening.\"I stupidly got on my bike this morning and got the sleet right in my face,\" she winces. Having dried off and freshened up, she settles down to chat. Marling has a reputation for being a shy, sometimes reluctant interviewee - but LA clearly has rubbed off on her. She chews gum as we talk, laughing bawdily as she discusses her penchant for dating drummers. (\"What do they bring to a relationship? Rhythm!\")The 27-year-old also reveals her mum keeps a \"very meticulous scrapbook\" of her career, and admits to cooking up her own brand of Halloumi cheese. \"I\'m aiming for direct competition with Alex James,\" she says, referring to the cheese-making Blur bassist. \"But bloody hell, what a boring thing to talk about\". So instead we circle back to that new album. It\'s her sixth, and possibly best, record since she emerged at the age of 17 as part of the indie folk movement that also spawned Mumford and Sons, Lucy Rose and Noah and the Whale. Sumptuous and sensual, Semper Femina adds a hint of West Coast sheen to her delicate, acoustic melodies. Marling generously credits her band and producer Blake Mills for the progression. \"All of the musicality of the album is down to them,\" she says. \"I wanted to be in the middle of it, but for someone else to be painting the picture around it.\"If you don\'t have a Latin textbook to hand, the album\'s title is taken from a line in Virgil\'s epic poem The Aeneid. The line is \"varium et mutabile semper femina\", which translates as \"woman is always fickle and changeable\". \"I thought that was very jolly,\" says Marling, apparently without sarcasm. She came across the phrase years ago and had a truncated version - \"Semper Femina\", or \"always a woman\" - tattooed on her leg when she was 21. It\'s a fitting title for a record that explores femininity in all its forms, from the archetypal wild teenager to the artist\'s muse, while reflecting on female friendships and betrayals. Marling prompted a lot of speculation when she announced in a press release that the album was written during a \"masculine time\" in her life, after she had \"gone on this trip of abandoning any sexuality\". She clarifies that today, saying she was simply trying to write about women from a \"neutral perspective\". But she admits LA prompted a period of androgyny.\"People there are just a bit more far-out,\" she explains. \"Nobody\'s got a job, they can dress however they want. A lot of my friends are queer or gender-fluid. So I was picking up on that.\"Then there was also my natural relationship with [womanhood]. I\'m unsure. I\'m unsure of my own femininity or masculinity.\"There are some circumstances in which I employ more of a masculine approach in order to protect myself; and there are circumstances where I indulge in my more feminine side because that vulnerability seems more important.\"I\'m interested in the differences between men and women, of which there are plenty, and they need to be understood better.\"Such as?\"Well, I was talking to my producer, Blake, and he said he started playing guitar to impress girls. I think when I started playing guitar, it was to impress my dad. \"So Blake\'s relationship to his instrument is very different to mine and his reason for writing songs is very different to mine but, at the same time, he is extraordinary. And so those differences can be great.\"You can reduce it down to an Eastern idea that men expend energy and women are self-perpetuating.\" One of the album\'s big themes is how women are observed - both by men and each other. On Wild Fire, Marling talks about a friend who keeps a \"pen behind her ear\" and constantly jots down her thoughts in a notepad.\"\" the singer drawls.\"\"That\'s a perennial question for a performer - especially one who seems so cautious of the limelight.\"Would I die to know how I\'m seen?\" she asks herself, when the lyric is brought up. \"I don\'t know!\"I\'m aware, obviously, that I\'m looked at and considered and reviewed and criticised. But I\'m pretty good at steering pretty clear of those [articles], unless they\'re delivered to me by my mother.\"On Nouel, she turns the tables - objectifying one of her real-life friends as a classic muse.\"?\" Marling pleads, going on to compare her friend to Gustave Courbet\'s Origine Du Monde - an 1866 painting of a woman sprawled naked on a bed. \"I was interested in what it is like to be made a muse,\" says Marling. \"Nouel is a person who exists, a visual artist I know in Los Angeles, and I took her essence and I exaggerated it into a fantasy.\"She [Nouel] was very flattered by it - but then again she was able to remove herself from it. \"It\'s her but it\'s not her. I haven\'t painted a picture of her - it\'s my projection of my feelings about how extraordinary I feel she is.\" In black and white this all seems very intellectual and, well, pretentious. Marling is quite aware of how it comes across, poking fun at the \"pseudo-science\" and \"pop psychology\" she espouses. On the album she even sings, \"\"But the music breathes warm life into these high concepts, resulting in a romantic, confessional suite of songs. By the last track, Nothing Not Nearly, Marling has put all the contemplation aside to observe: \"\"It reflects her current, contented state of mind.\"I\'m loving my late twenties,\" she says. \"The closer I get to 30, the more at ease I feel with myself.\"Each of her albums has contributed to that sense of self, she continues.\"This one was about understanding femininity and masculinity. The last one was understanding solitude.\"Before that was heartbreak, before that was freedom and before that was anger. It\'s like I\'m tackling the world one emotion at a time!\"So what\'s next? Rebellion? Passion? Paranoia?\"Possibly. Or fear, given the era that we\'re seemingly stepping into,\" she says. \"It\'s not been good.\" She talks about the \"horrifying but unbearably addictive quality\" of President Trump, saying she\'s constantly checking her phone for the latest update. While the Trump era has already prompted a surge in political protest songs, Marling has trouble viewing this as a positive.\"I don\'t think anyone would wish that on the world for the sake of writing a good song. That\'s not the purpose of art - to encounter animosity for the sake of having something to do.\"A singer, who\'s now a big singer, once said to me: \'It\'d be so cool to be really heartbroken because it\'d be good for my songwriting.\"\"I was like, \'You silly, naive wally!\' Never wish that on yourself. It\'s unbearable.\" ',entertainment
'High heels row: MPs \'shocked\' by women\'s dress code stories An inquiry into work dress codes has exposed \"widespread discrimination\" against women, MPs have said. The investigation was prompted by a petition, being debated by MPs, that called for a ban on requiring women to wear high heels at work. MPs said they were \"shocked\" by stories submitted as part of the inquiry, which included one case of a woman who had been told to dye her hair blonde. The government has said no employer should discriminate on gender grounds. Work dress codes \"must be reasonable\", it said. More than set up by Nicola Thorp, from London, after she was sent home from her temp job when she refused to wear shoes with a \"2in to 4in heel\". It was debated in Parliament because it reached more than 100, 000 signatures. Helen Jones, who chairs the Petitions Committee, said : \"It is fair to say that what we found shocked us.\"We found attitudes that belonged more [to the] - I was going to say 1950s but probably the 1850s might be more accurate - than the 21st Century. \"[The inquiry] has exposed widespread discrimination against women, stereotypical views of what women should look like and dress like and behave like.\"It\'s shown up out-dated attitudes towards women in the workplace, and it has shown that constantly women are belittled when they try to challenge those attitudes.\"She said there was a \"long way\" to go to solve the problems, but \"everyone in the workplace deserves better than this\". Speaking in the same debate, Labour\'s Gill Furniss said her daughter had suffered a metatarsal fracture having had to wear high heels in a retail job. \"Quite literally adding insult to injury, she was denied any compensation or sick pay as she wasn\'t on the payroll for long enough,\" she added. Long-term damage The committee published its findings in a report in January, which said hundreds of women had shared their stories about the pain caused by wearing high heels for long periods, requirements to wear revealing outfits and constantly reapply make-up. It said discriminatory dress codes were \"widespread\" and the existing law was \"not yet fully effective in protecting employees from discrimination at work\". The petitions committee called on the government to review the law and to ask Parliament to change it if necessary, to make it more effective. 1970s diktat\' It also recommended that the government \"substantially increases\" the penalties available to employment tribunals which find against employers. For the government, Equalities Minister Caroline Dinenage urged employers to review dress codes and make \"dodgy 1970s workplace diktats\" a thing of the past. She has written to key trade bodies about the \"outdated and sexist employment practices\" uncovered in this case. She said: \"We have had anti-discrimination laws in this area for more than 40 years, yet it is a safe bet that these sort of dress codes have existed under the radar, with female employees putting up with discrimination because that is the way things are.\"Shod in heels or flats, we are collectively putting our foot down and attitudes are changing. \"This petition has brought that change very clearly into the public domain.\"Women should not be expected to wear things that caused discomfort or expense that a male colleague would not, she added.\"I must reiterate that the government utterly condemns such dress requirements where their effects are discriminatory.\"',politics
'What if all schools were tech investors? It\'s no coincidence that by investing early in Snapchat is in the middle of Mountain View, California. When the parents of your students are some of the world\'s wealthiest technology investors then, well, it\'s smart to make the most of it. Saint Francis High School\'s incredible windfall wasn\'t a fluke - it was the result of a patient process which began in 1990, when it set up a development fund to raise cash for the school. The fund has been bankrolled by parents and alumni who know their stuff - particularly when it comes to making bets on technology stock. At $17, 000 a year for tuition, the school isn\'t exactly strapped for cash. Its campus, where I spent Friday morning, is leafy, green and well-equipped outside and in. The 1, 760 students that come here are lucky, privileged, and most likely on their way to great things. The development fund was set up to, among other things, provide money for scholarships that are offered out to kids from less well-off families in the area. And with the Snap deal, the fund has swollen to phenomenal new heights - $24m so far, with many more millions set to come. All from a $15, 000 investment. It made me wonder - why doesn\'t this kind of thing happen more often? $15, 000 is small change to the budgets of venture capital firms around the world, particularly in Silicon Valley where $25bn was invested in tech companies in 2016 - an apparently \"bad\" year. Deal breakers Most schools can\'t afford to put together a fund like Saint Francis. But then, why should they need to? What if investment firms allowed a small slice of the money they invest to be kept by for schools, charities or other needy causes so that if and when the ship comes in, it\'s life changing for the many rather than the few?\"I think in Silicon Valley especially, or places with a lot of entrepreneurship, I think it\'s great for investors to reach out to local institutions and schools and see if they can include them in some of their deals,\" said Barry Eggers, founding partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, the firm that led Snap\'s first investment round. This week that investment became worth more than a billion dollars. It was Mr Eggers\' idea to involve Saint Francis in the deal five years ago, based on the enthusiasm of his children, who loved Snapchat.\"They were sitting around the kitchen table one day and they were all on their cellphones laughing. They said \'Dad, have you seen this app, Snapchat?\'\"My daughter said \'I used to use it five times a day, now I use it 30 times a day!\'.\"He sees no reason why the success at Saint Francis can\'t be emulated at other schools - but it won\'t happen easily.\"These institutions have to have a programme. It can\'t be a one-off, that\'s not going to work. They have to commit to doing this.\"His point is it takes time and money, and it\'s about playing the numbers. Schools won\'t be able to just invest $15, 000, sit back for a few years and see the success roll in. There will be vastly more misses than hits. Prediction model students At Saint Francis, as school president Simon Chiu was fielding questions from the nation\'s media, the music of Bruno Mars soundtracked a dancing competition, an event held as part of a week of activities designed to de-stress students. The school didn\'t want us disrupting the day, or the dance-off, so we weren\'t able to get the view of the kids in what right now is America\'s most talked about school. That\'s a shame, as the future of Snapchat rests in high schools like this one across the country, and eventually - if the app can grow as investors hope - the entire world. But only if it remains \"cool\". Just as Mr Eggers\' daughter was the early-adopter that predicted Snap\'s success, the students that are studying at the school nowadays would be the harshest critics of whether or not it will succeed. Maybe they\'ve already moved onto the next big thing. \"Certainly we know that kids are the first people to figure out what\'s hot and what\'s new and what\'s desirable,\" said Mr Chiu. He too hopes the school\'s success will lead other venture capital firms to work in the same way.\"I think this is an amazing way for venture capital folks, or companies, to share these experiences with schools.\"I would hope that companies would look at this as an example of something they can do to help their local community.\"Paying more tax would be a better way, of course, but that\'s a debate for another day. For now, Silicon Valley is basking in the enjoyment of a huge success that will trickle down into the tech start-up ecosystem, meaning more money for new companies. A success like Snap is rare. But deals happen here every day - acquisitions and exits that have created a new breed of super rich. As California\'s newest billionaires celebrate this weekend, perhaps we should imagine the impact if every big deal held aside just a few thousand dollars at the beginning for a good cause. It would allow the needy causes to accumulate real wealth. Now that would be truly disruptive, wouldn\'t it?',tech
'Six Nations 2017: Wales Women 7-12 Ireland Women Ireland stayed on course for a Grand Slam decider against England as they battled to a 12-7 win over Wales at Cardiff Arms Park. Hannah Tyrell\'s corner try after 62 minutes rewarded the visitors\' second-half pressure. Lindsey Peat drove over from close range just before half-time to put Ireland 7-0 up. Wales struck back through Shona Powell-Hughes but could not break out of defence in the final quarter. The teams took part in a minute\'s applause before the anthems in tribute to Elli Norkett, the 20 year-old Ospreys and Wales winger two weeks previously. The first half looked as though it might be scoreless with both teams seeing spells of pressure ended by conceding penalties at crucial times. But prop Peat eventually broke the deadlock just before the break when Ireland kicked a penalty to the corner, and she drove over from the line-out, with Nora Stapleton converting. A fine break from Dyddgu Hywel put Wales on the front foot straight after the interval and Peat was yellow-carded after a series of Irish offences. Wales took advantage of the extra player as Powell-Hughes went over from a scrum five, Robyn Wilkins chipping over the conversion to level after 44 minutes. It was Wales\' turn to lose a prop to the sin-bin as Amy Evans was penalised for a high tackle and Peat came close to grabbing a second try as she was held up on the line. Captain Paula Fitzpatrick was also over the line twice either side of the hour mark as her team turned the screw, but could not ground the ball. The visitors\' pressure finally paid when wing Tyrell was worked clear on the overlap in the corner after 62 minutes. It proved to be the final score of the game as Ireland continued to dominate territory, and fly-half Stapleton was named player of the match. Ireland host England at Donnybrook on Friday 17 March with the Six Nations title at stake, while Wales face France in Brive the following day. \"Playing on your own ground and not coming away with a win is always tough, but the girls dug deep and showed passion all the way through.\"With such a tough week, we performed but it didn\'t go our way, and we know we would have made Elli (Norkett) proud today.\"It was very emotional, but if her family can get through it, then we can, we\'re a team and we\'re one unit, so proud of the girls.\"We\'ve all admitted it wasn\'t our best performance in Scotland, but we tried to put the wrongs right and I think we\'ve done that today.\" \"It was a really close game and the Welsh really put it up to us with a great first half, a huge performance from them and they\'ve really done credit to Elli Norkett.\"We came close with a couple of chances but we really had to grind it out, they had a good defence and we really had to work for it.\"I\'m really looking forward to playing England, it should be a big crowd on Paddy\'s Night and hopefully we can fill Donnybrook, get the crowd behind us and it\'s going to be a cup final.\"Dyddgu Hywel (Scarlets); Elen Evans (Scarlets), Kerin Lake (Ospreys), Rebecca de Filippo (Newport Gwent Dragons), Adi Taviner (Ospreys); Robyn Wilkins (Ospreys), Keira Bevan (Ospreys); Caryl Thomas (Scarlets), Carys Phillips (capt) (Ospreys), Amy Evans (Ospreys), Rebecca Rowe (Dragons), Mel Clay (Ospreys), Sioned Harries (Scarlets), Rachel Taylor (Scarlets), Shona Powell-Hughes (Ospreys).

'Government borrowing falls in February Government borrowing fell last month to its lowest amount for February in 10 years, according to official figures. Borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, was £1. 8bn, down from £4. 6bn a year earlier, In the financial year-to-date, borrowing has fallen by £19. 9bn from last year to £47. 8bn. Analysts said the figures meant the government was on track to meet revised borrowing targets. In the Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility revised its end-of-year borrowing forecast to £51. 7bn, down from its earlier forecast of £68. 2bn. \'Fiscal ammunition\' The ONS said corporation tax receipts had risen by 21. 3\% in the first 11 months of the financial year to just over £50bn, while income from tax and National Insurance contributions rose by 6. 5\% to £280bn. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Markit, said Chancellor Philip Hammond was \"clearly keen to keep fiscal ammunition up his sleeve - due to the major uncertainties and downside risks that the economy faces as it navigates its way out of the EU\".\"Despite the resilience of the economy so far since last June\'s Brexit vote, the chancellor is very well aware that a challenging road lies ahead,\" he said. \"Furthermore, an appreciable budget deficit is still seen existing in 2021-22 so there is still work to be done then on getting the public finances back to full health.\" ',business
'Is Emma Watson anti-feminist for exposing her breasts? Emma Watson\'s decision to expose part of her breasts in a Vanity Fair photoshoot has sparked a fierce debate on social media about what it means to be a feminist.\"She complains that women are sexualised and then sexualises herself in her own work. Hypocrisy,\" said radio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer . Watson said she was \"confused\" by accusations she is \"anti-feminist\" and there was a real \"misunderstanding\" about what it actually means. So can you bare your breasts and still be a feminist? \"Emma Watson has done more for women and for young girls than most of us put together,\" says Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality and women\'s rights. \"So I don\'t really see that just because she\'s made that decision, any of us should be criticising her.\"She\'s an empowered woman who is posing for a very tasteful image. She\'s not being exploited, she doing it in a controlling position. It\'s a positive use of her body.\"Sexist News, the team behind the campaign for the Sun to stop using topless models on Page 3, said it loved that the former Harry Potter star was \"exploring and championing feminism having grown up in the public eye\". It believes the row created by the photoshoot is \"daft\", adding: \"It is not a debate that we have about men\'s fashion shoots, regardless of the amounts of nipple-grazing crochet they wear. \"While no woman gets to dress herself outside of our society\'s patriarchal bubble, this example just shows that someone like Emma Watson is going to face an even more impossible standard than many other women.\" Victoria Jenkinson, 20, a member of Girlguiding, believes the shoot has been used as a opportunity to \"stir up a frenzy\" around Watson and \"undermine\" her work promoting women\'s rights.\"The shoot doesn\'t suggest hypocrisy nor does it undermine her work as a feminist and we as women should be united in our fight for equality more than ever before,\" she said.\"I don\'t understand why people have an idea they can tell a woman what she can and can\'t do and I agree with Emma that critics have missed the point. \"A woman should be able to choose what she wants to do. This is what feminism is all about in 2017.\"But Dr Finn Mackay, a feminism researcher at the University of West England, rejects the view that feminism is about giving women \"choice\" and says it is a social justice movement.\"Emma\'s saying feminism is about choice and the choice to do whatever you want, but that\'s a nonsense,\" she says. \"Some women choose terrible things, some women choose to work for parties that deny women access to abortion, access to healthcare or mothers access to welfare.\" However, she does not believe that Watson\'s pose for Vanity Fair means she is not a feminist.\"If she self identifies as a feminist and believes in promoting women\'s rights, her doing her job doesn\'t necessarily have to undermine that.\"I think if she\'s trying to say being in a photoshoot and getting your breast out is a feminist act, that\'s a different matter.\"But Dr Mackay believes promoting feminism is more effective through the voice and not the body.\"The most radical thing that women can do in this culture is keep their clothes on and open their mouths and make political points,\" she says. The controversy surrounding Watson\'s magazine shoot has brought into question what it means to be a feminist. But equality groups and feminists say the debate should be focused on female objectification and inequality. \'Dig at feminism\' Ms Smethers says: \"The real issue about all of this is the pressure on young women to look a certain way, to be judged on their appearance so if we are going to focus on anything that\'s what I would be more concerned to be prioritised.\"Dr Mackay questions why the debate has been reduced to a celebrity exposing her breasts rather than issues such as women\'s economic positions and cuts to women\'s services.\"A Hollywood celebrity flashing a bit of boob is really the least of my worries,\" she says. \"It\'s interesting that people only speak about it now and their real motivation seems to be to want to have a dig at feminism rather than to talk about the overall problems Hollywood has with objectifying women.\"Sexist News adds: \"We really need to examine why on earth this one fashion image has caused such outrage. This is not to say that images of fashion or celebrity are unproblematic, quite the contrary. \"As ever the focus is on what a woman should or shouldn\'t be doing and not on how our culture presents, polices and consumes women\'s bodies and condemns their actions. \"We need to challenge these things, not the individual women stuck in the system.\"Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

'Osborne to earn £650, 000 a year advising US financial firm Former Chancellor George Osborne is to be paid £650, 000 a year for advising the US fund manager Blackrock. In an he disclosed that he would be paid £162, 500 each quarter and would work 48 days a year. He has already earned close to £800, 000 for speeches made to banks and other firms since leaving office in July The MP for Tatton said he had consulted the business appointments watchdog before taking on the Blackrock job. The register of members\' interests also states Mr Osborne expects to receive \"registrable equity\"- shares - in Blackrock \"in the future\". The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments advises ministers on whether it is appropriate for them to take on jobs within two years of leaving office. When it named him as an adviser to its Investment Institute in January, Blackrock said Mr Osborne would provide \"perspectives on European politics and policy and Chinese economic reforms\" as well as wider geo-political trends. He joins his former chief of staff, Rupert Harrison, who is a senior strategist for the US investment firm. Former foreign secretary William Hague joined Citigroup as an adviser earlier this year while former prime minister Gordon Brown sits on the global advisory board at investment manager Pimco, and his predecessor Tony Blair joined JP Morgan in 2008 shortly after leaving office. Mr Osborne, who served as chancellor between 2010 and 2016 before being sacked by Theresa May after she took power, was in the Commons on Wednesday to watch his successor Philip Hammond deliver his first Budget. After the event, that \"sound money and fiscal responsibility are the only secure foundations of a fair and strong economy\". ',politics
'My journey from fleeing Iran to making the internet safer Niloofar Howe is a rare woman working in internet security. Her path to being the chief strategy officer of internet security firm RSA started when she travelled on her own to the US at 11-years-old. Ms Howe remembers vividly arriving at San Francisco airport on her own.\"A tall, lanky, moustached immigration agent spends what feels like an eternity questioning me. I know the stakes are high. I know my family\'s future depends on me passing this interview\" she explained at a . Her family had fled Iran shortly before the 1979 revolution. They went to the UK and a few months later put her on a flight to the US as they \"calculated that an 11-year-old girl on her own will not be turned away by immigration,\" she said. Their calculation paid off. The customs officer stamped her Iranian passport and she started her new life. The first thing she had to do was adapt to California - a place she described as \"where all-you-can eat buffets and free-thinking rebellion are the norm\". She found her safe space in coding.\"I was happy in the computer room,\" she told the BBC.\"I was an immigrant, trying to fit in a girls\' school and the computer room was a safe place to be.\"Sidetracked by Spielberg But at 17-years-old she took an entirely different direction. She \"fudged\" a few details on her CV and applied for a job as a casting assistant for Steven Spielberg.\"My 1968 birthday changed to 1966 so I could work legally full-time in that job,\" she explained.\"I remember trying to stay as close to the truth as possible.\"Ms Howe was in her senior year at school, but was also doing a course at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) so just didn\'t mention the bit about school. She had also been an assistant director in theatre productions and gave that a prominent showing in her CV. She got the job and for around eight months she moonlighted between casting for a TV show and her senior year at high school. The UCLA course gave her more freedom than in normal high school and when she needed to take an exam she told her boss that she had a doctor\'s appointment. It would be decades before she returned to the world of coding. In that time she went from being an entertainment lawyer to business consultant to angel investor to venture capitalist. Ms Howe was meeting with the cyber security company Endgame to talk about investing in them when she was offered a job by the chief executive.\"He said \'raising money is not going to be a problem. What I need is a business partner\'.\"She took the job of chief strategic officer and eventually moved to a bigger cyber security company RSA. She described the path back to the computer room as \"circular\" and said she had been \"distracted\" by \"bright shiny things\" in the entertainment industry. But Ms Howe said she was not alone, as a female, in her interest in technology not turning into a career at first. Over the nine years of investing in tech, she said she had only met a \"handful\" of female company founders. Protective urge But Ms Howe urged women to consider working in internet security specifically. She said making the internet safe was a \"mission\" that \"appeals to women\".\"Solving a problem that makes the world safer, makes our personal lives safer and makes our children online safer,\" is how she put it. Internet security companies are struggling to fill vacancies and she said the demand for workers was only going to become bigger.

'Meet the Donald Trump of Indonesia On top of a rock formation on the Indonesian island of Bali, sits Tanah Lot. It\'s a simple 16th century Balinese temple, set against a backdrop of the Indian Ocean, but it\'s about to get a very 21st century neighbour. Just across the beach from here is the sprawling but dated Bali Nirwana Resort. And in a few months time, construction will begin to transform it into the first Trump-branded resort on the island. Yes. That Trump. The site was bought in 2013 by businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo, Indonesia\'s 29th richest man according to Forbes Magazine. And in 2015 he signed a $1bn (£820m) deal with Donald Trump to build and develop a Trump Hotel and Tower in West Java, as well as the six-star in Bali. Mr Tanoesodibjo will pay for the construction and give the Trump Organisation an undisclosed fee for the use of the name and rights to manage the resorts. But that\'s not where the connection with the US President ends.\'Close access\' Known for his forthright and straightforward views, Mr Tanoesoedibjo, or Hary Tanoe, is often called Indonesia\'s Donald Trump. A media mogul, he runs , a vast conglomerate that spans financial services, media and property. Set up in 1997, it was listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange. And like the man in the White House, he\'s also a . But his connection to Mr Trump has created a fair amount of controversy both in Indonesia and overseas. In a recent interview with an Indonesian magazine, Mr Tanoesoedibjo reportedly said that he had \"close access\" to the US President, raising eyebrows about the potential conflicts of interest in this relationship. But speaking to me in the cosy library of his palatial home, he told me that the two shared a \"normal business relationship.\" And he fully believes President Trump when he says he\'s no longer involved in the day-to-day .\"I have to underline this,\" Mr Tanoesoedibjo says. \"Since he\'s president of the United States, he\'s no longer involved in the business so I basically deal with the children, Eric Trump and Don Jr.\"VIP treatment But the two men have met, and fairly recently. Mr Tanoesoedibjo and his wife were invited to the president\'s inauguration, and treated like VIP guests. His wife posted photos of their time with the Trump family on her social media feeds. So surely there\'s a perception that if the two men are close, there\'s a conflict of interest, I asked him. How can he convince people otherwise? \"There\'s no conflict of interest,\" he says categorically. \"Conflict of interest may happen if the project is agreed upon when he is a president. But this happened long before he even decided to run for president.\" \'Naive\' Still, some of Mr Trump\'s controversial decisions since coming to office, not least the widely interpreted as targeting Muslims, have had an impact on Mr Tanoesoedibjo\'s reputation in the predominantly Islamic Indonesia.\"People will look at him (Mr Tanoesoedibjo) as a kid trying to follow big brother, as naive,\" popular radio talk show host Wimar Witoelar told me in his studio. \"He shouldn\'t run around with people like Trump. Both are pragmatic businessmen, they would explore any opportunities to make money... but what would people in the US think if Trump has a business connection in Indonesia? It\'s a Muslim-majority country. Where is his consistency?\" Mr Tanoesodibjo is quick to rebut these claims.\"Mr Trump is not banning the Muslims,\" he insists. \"He\'s banning the country, the people of those countries. I think we have to be very clear on that…[it\'s] nothing to do with Muslim people.\" The two men have more than just business in common. Mr Tanoesoedibjo has set up his own political party, and has already run for office once. He hasn\'t ruled out running for president of Indonesia, taking leadership lessons from his business partner perhaps? In his library, I notice that Mr Tanoesoedibjo has kept one of Mr Trump\'s books in pride of place. \"Not only does he inspire me, I think he inspires everyone,\" he says. \"With basically minimum experience in politics, minimum experience in bureaucracy, he can become President of the United States.\"',business
'Oscars: Meryl Streep vents fury at Karl Lagerfeld in dress row Meryl Streep\'s choice of dress for the Oscars has sparked a bitter row between the star and designer Karl Lagerfeld. Chanel\'s creative director accused Streep of rejecting one of his dresses because she found a different designer who was willing to pay her. He has since said he \"misunderstood\" - but that has not calmed Streep\'s ire.\"I do not take this lightly, and Mr Lagerfeld\'s generic \'statement\' of regret for this \'controversy\' was not an apology,\" she said. She also criticised , which originally reported his quotes. \"He lied, they printed the lie, and I am still waiting,\" she said in a statement. The dispute began when WWD published an interview in which Lagerfeld said he had started work on a dress for Streep to wear to Sunday\'s Academy Awards. But he claimed he was then told by one of the actress\'s representatives: \"Don\'t continue the dress. We found somebody who will pay us.\"Referring to Streep, he said: \"A genius actress, but cheapness also, no?\"The designer later issued a statement admitting he had \"misunderstood that Ms Streep may have chosen another designer due to remuneration\" and said he regretted the controversy.

'Nicola Sturgeon sees \'sense of solidarity\' with London after attack First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has expressed her concern for those caught up in the terrorist attack at Westminster. She spoke of a \"sense of solidarity\" felt in Scotland for people in London. Four people have died after a car was driven at pedestrians near the UK parliament before the occupant jumped out and stabbed a police officer. The Scottish Parliament suspended a debate on an independence referendum following the attack. Ms Sturgeon said: \"My thoughts, as I\'m sure the thoughts of everybody in Scotland tonight, are with people caught up in this dreadful event. \"My condolences in particular go to those who\'ve lost loved ones.\"My thoughts are with those who\'ve sustained injuries and we all feel a sense of solidarity with the people of London tonight.\"She said Scotland would consider whether there were any wider lessons for public safety. The first minister added: \"I convened a meeting of the Scottish Government\'s Resilience Committee to review what is currently known about the incident at Westminster and also to review any implications for Scotland.\"(But) it is important to stress that there is no intelligence of any risk to Scotland.\" The Scottish Parliament had been close to concluding its debate on a call for a referendum on Scottish independence when Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh announced that the sitting would be suspended. He said the incident in London was affecting the contributions of MSPs, and that the debate would resume at another time. A vote had been due to be held at 17: 30, but politicians including Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson called for the session to be suspended. Parliament officials initially ruled that the debate should continue as planned, before Mr Macintosh decided that it should be halted. The presiding officer said: \"The fact that our sister parliament has had a serious incident is affecting this particular debate, and is affecting the contribution of members. And so it is for that reason we are deciding to suspend the sitting.\"We will resume this debate and we will be able to do so in a full and frank manner, but I think to continue at the moment would not allow members to make their contributions in the manner they wish to.\"The debate is expected to continue next week, with a decision due to be made on Thursday morning. Conservative MSP Fin Carson tweeted ahead of the presiding officer\'s ruling that he had left the parliament chamber, saying: \"I can\'t understand how this debate can go on. At least a suspension would have shown some respect.\"However, some politicians were unhappy about the decision to suspend the debate. Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles was among those to argue it was a \"mistake\", telling BBC Scotland that had huge sympathy for those affected by the attack, but that: \"We should not be giving in to terrorism, and I believe we\'ve done that\". Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham was also unhappy with the decision - but was later said to agree entirely after learning the full details of the London attack. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had been expected to win the backing of a majority of MSPs for her plan to ask the UK government for a section 30 order, which would be needed to hold a legally-binding referendum on independence. The UK government has already said it will block the move, and will not enter into any negotiations until after the Brexit process has been completed. An increased police presence could be seen in and around the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood on Wednesday afternoon. An email to MSPs, staff and Holyrood pass-holders from the Scottish Parliament chief executive\'s office said: \"While there is no intelligence to suggest there is a specific threat to Scotland, Edinburgh or Holyrood, we have increased security with immediate effect at the Scottish Parliament as a precaution.\"Police vehicles were seen outside the parliament building, with a spokesman for Police Scotland saying the force was \"liaising with colleagues in London and will ensure appropriate safety and security plans are in place based upon what we know\".

'Sinclair ZX Vega+ funding campaign halted by Indiegogo Crowdfunding platform Indiegogo intervened to stop a handheld retro computer console campaign from acquiring further funding, the BBC has learned., backed by Sir Clive Sinclair, had achieved its original crowdfunding target. But then Indiegogo halted further fundraising because of delivery delays and a lack of communication to backers. The project\'s organisers had asked the BBC not to reveal the development. The BBC understands no consoles have been delivered to backers, despite a pledge last month that they would \"ship after 20 Feb 2017\". And the company behind the project - Retro Computers Limited - suggested these details might put its team at risk.\"Following a credible threat of violence against personnel of Retro Computers Limited, including threats made as recently as last night, we asked [technology desk editor] Leo Kelion and the BBC to refrain from publishing a story we believe to be factually inaccurate and might put people at risk of physical harm, alarm and distress,\" Retro Computers Limited founder David Levy said in a statement on Wednesday.\"Since December 2016 the BBC have formally been on notice that this is a police matter, and we ask that the BBC and Mr Kelion do not compromise the police investigation.\"The BBC delayed publication of this report to give RCL managing director Suzanne Martin time to provide evidence of the threats, but she did not do so. In the meantime, the Gizmodo news site also an article about the matter because it too was told of threats. Refund requests RCL had already received more than £513, 000 ($624, 000) from Indiegogo crowdfunders for the Vega+ . And before the fundraising campaign was halted, the project had been listed as \"in demand\" to allow new people to become backers, despite having already reached its funding target. But in recent weeks, many backers have expressed anger that they still have not received their console and claimed their requests for more information were going unanswered by the company. Although, Indiegogo is clear that those who back a project are supporting an idea rather than buying a product - and that hardware in particular tends to be more difficult to deliver. In 2015, RCL brought a to fruition after a smaller campaign. Lawyers\' letter RCL originally said the new Spectrum ZX Vega+ was due to go into production in the summer of 2016 and it might even \"be able to improve on this delivery date\". But in December 2016, after the BBC contacted RCL to ask about the status of the Vega+, the broadcaster was threatened with legal action.\"Our clients are concerned that the BBC is in fact supporting and participating in a malicious campaign intended to denigrate our clients\' reputation,\" wrote lawyers Michelmores LLP in a letter to the broadcaster. They went on to request that the BBC show them its report at least 48 hours ahead of publication so they could identify any false information, which the BBC refused to do. Ms Martin then apologised to backers for the delays and said there had been .\"In November, we identified an improvement we believed was essential to the Vega+ gaming experience,\" she said at the time. \"An improvement that would make the feel of the product far better, including a correction in the design of one of the buttons, making it more robust and able to withstand the rigours of extended game-play. \"We also wanted to make sure we did justice to the Sinclair legacy. \"This change has caused a brief delay, and we are truly sorry about that, but we needed this time to improve the product, and we have now completed the necessary revisions, and we are delighted to announce that we will ship the first units in February 2017.\"Since then, RCL has suggested it had been unable to respond to some backers\' requests because of a business dispute with two former directors. And in its last public update, 11 days ago, the company .\'Last chance\' Many , which remains live but has stopped taking funds, are requests for refunds. \"I don\'t expect a response. I\'m just being polite in letting them know this is their last chance before they have to deal with small claims court,\" wrote a backer called Paul Brookfield.\"Please receive this email as written notice of cancellation of my pledge and a request for a refund,\" wrote Drew Miller.\"I no longer believe you are capable of providing the product I pledged for in April, considering the drastic number of delays and your lack of communication toward fellow backers.\"',tech
'Ryan McBride: Michael O\'Neill leads tributes to Derry City captain Northern Ireland boss Michael O\'Neill has led the tributes to Derry City captain Ryan McBride, who has died at the age of 27.

McBride\'s funeral will take place on Thursday at 10: 00 GMT at St Columba\'s Church in Derry, after which the player will be buried in the city cemetery. The league game between Derry City and Limerick, due to take place on 21 March, will be rescheduled. McBride\'s death is the latest tragedy to befall the club following the death of striker and the which claimed the lives of members of winger Josh Daniels a year ago.\'He led boys to become men\' Northern Ireland manager O\'Neill was manager of League of Ireland Premier Division side Shamrock Rovers when McBride joined Derry six years ago.\"When I first saw him play, I remember thinking, \'what a fantastic young defender\'. He was strong, physical and hugely committed.\"His leadership qualities were evident even at such a young age and it was no surprise to me that he became such an inspirational player for his hometown club.\" Derry City manager Kenny Shiels said the death was \"hard for everybody to take\" and that he was \"the perfect example to any young player coming through\".

'Wood Group agrees takeover of rival Amec Foster Wheeler Amec Foster Wheeler has agreed to a £2. 2bn takeover by Wood Group in a deal that brings together two of the UK\'s largest energy services companies. Wood Group hopes to cut £110m in costs from the combined business, which will provide services to the oil and gas, chemicals and mining sectors. The deal will create a company with a combined value of about £5bn. Shares in Amec soared 14. 7\% to 561p, while Aberdeen-based Wood Group\'s shares climbed 4. 4\% to 785p. 564p a share for its British rival. Mark Wilson, an analyst at Jefferies, said: \"While materially above our Amec valuation, we can see Wood Group consolidating its market-leading UK North Sea business, expanding product lines in the US and possibly increasing the scope for asset sales.\" The deal has emerged at a difficult time for both businesses amid continued oil price volatility. Amec was due to raise £500m through a rights issue next week, although this has now been suspended. The funds were due to be used to reduce its £1bn debt pile and for a reorganisation of the company. It was formed by the merger of Amec and American firm Foster Wheeler three years ago. Amec also that last year\'s revenues fell 8\% to £5. 4bn after \"continuing weakness\" in the oil and gas market offset strong performances elsewhere in its business. That weakness was also partly responsible for a £56m slide in profit to £318m. In February, Wood Group revealed a revenues had fallen 16\% last year to $4. 9bn, while pre-tax profit halved to $66m. The company has been shedding staff and last year it cut about 18\% of its employees. Under the terms of the deal, Amec shareholders will end up with 44\% of the larger group. The management of Wood Group - chief executive Robin Watson, finance chief David Kemp and chairman Ian Marchant - will continue in their roles following completion of the deal. Wood Group chairman Ian Marchant said: \"The combination extends the scale and scope of our services, deepens our existing customer relationships, facilitates further development of our technology-enabled solutions and broadens our end market, geographic and customer exposure.\"Delivering significant sustainable synergies will also result in a leaner and more competitive combined group, creating value for shareholders.\"',business
'Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain to front new BBC cookery show Ever since the BBC lost The Great British Bake Off to Channel 4 last year, many have been watching the BBC\'s moves closely. Clearly, the corporation couldn\'t commission a similar show to Bake Off, as it no longer owns the format. But it also has millions of viewers who are now hungry for more cookery programmes. So, in October, BBC Two announced it would air new food-based series The Big Family Cooking Showdown - and it\'s now been confirmed it will star former Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain. She will co-host it with Zoe Ball, while chefs Rosemary Shrager and Giorgio Locatelli will serve as judges. Sixteen families will invite the four stars of the show into their own kitchens to cook their favourite family recipes and will be whittled down through a series of challenges across 12 hour-long episodes. The new Bake Off? This isn\'t the first BBC programme Nadiya will have appeared in since Bake Off - she\'s already fronted a two-part documentary and will also about British food. After she was announced as the co-presenter of The Big Family Cooking Showdown, some have suggested the programme sounded similar to The Great British Bake Off. But Buzzfeed\'s TV editor Scott Bryan said he thought that wasn\'t the case. He pointed to the fact it will be broadcast on the more niche BBC Two, and not the flagship BBC One channel which The Great British Bake Off aired on. Having said that, Bake Off originally started on BBC Two in 2010 with small viewing figures, and moved to its bigger sister-channel after it had become a ratings hit. So if the new cookery programme is popular, it\'s possible it could make a similar leap a few years down the line. Another reason it\'s being seen by some as a rival to Channel 4\'s Bake Off is because the two programmes could be broadcast around the same time of year. The BBC confirmed the first series of The Big Family Cooking Showdown will go out in the autumn - which might also be when the new Bake Off will air. Channel 4 have not yet confirmed an exact start date but it will , and it\'s likely that the they would want the series to be completed before the year is out. The fact that Nadiya is so closely associated with the GBBO brand is perhaps another reason the new show being likened to Bake Off. The comparisons may be inevitable, but one thing we can be sure of is that the BBC will ensure the new programme has a completely different format to its former ratings hit. Analysis \"Big\" has replaced \"Great\", \"Bake Off\" has become \"Cooking Showdown\" and it\'s got a four-person presenting and judging team. The comparisons are easy to make. However, the idea was germinating before Bake Off made off to Channel 4. But what began as an attempt to tap in to GBBO\'s homely magic of nice people trying their best now looks like a rival, albeit one without a tent or Mary Berry. Pitching this as a copycat rival to the Great British Bake Off makes a great headline but doesn\'t stand up to much scrutiny. Of course, that doesn\'t mean something else more like Bake Off might appear on the airwaves. TV companies spend millions on formats but legal protection for the ideas is far from clear legally, with disputes rarely making it to court. The one thing that would probably stop it though is the fear that after creating a \"copycat\" it fails to draw in the viewers. That\'s a headline the TV bosses would really like to avoid.

'Don\'t give up, Jeremy Corbyn urges Labour Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour\'s by-election loss shows \"the scale of how hard our task is to persuade people of our message\". In a speech, he urged his party to \"remain united\", and not to \"give up\". Labour lost the seat of Copeland, in Cumbria, to the Conservatives last week - the first by-election gain by a governing party in 35 years. Tory chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin said it had been a \"fantastic result\" for Prime Minister Theresa May. Labour\'s deputy leader, Tom Watson, accused some of Mr Corbyn\'s \"cheerleaders\" of \"peeling away from him\" during a difficult time. While the party lost in Cumbria, the party managed to hold off a challenge from UKIP in a by-election, in Stoke-on-Trent Central, on Thursday. In his speech to the Scottish Labour Party conference in Perth, Mr Corbyn said: \"The policies and ideas we are setting out are policies whose time has come. But to win that fight we need to remain united.\" But Mr Corbyn, Labour leader since 2015, said: \"The scale of how hard our task is to persuade people of our message was underlined just this week in Copeland.\"Whilst we stood up to hatred and division in Stoke, I cannot lie and say the result in Copeland was what we wanted. But now is not the time to retreat, to run away or to give up.\"Mr Corbyn called losing Copeland - which had been held by the party since its creation in 1983 - \"deeply disappointing\" and added that he took \"my share of responsibility\". Questioned about his future after the speech, Mr Corbyn said: \"I\'m carrying on as leader because I\'m determined that we will deliver social justice in this country.\"Asked if he would still be in place in 2020, when the next general election is expected to take place, he replied: \"I\'ve given you a very, very clear answer - yes.\" Speaking on BBC One\'s Andrew Marr Show, Sir Patrick McLoughlin said: \"Copeland was a fantastic result for the prime minister.\"He added: \"It shows that all seats are seats that we will look at, and we are going to challenge hard at the general election.\"Meanwhile Tom Watson, told ITV1\'s Peston on Sunday the team who got Mr Corbyn elected for a second time \"seem to be peeling away from him\" and he queried where Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey was at this \"difficult time\". He said it should not just be up to him to defend Mr Corbyn, but a Unite spokesman said that as Labour\'s deputy leader it was \"his job to address the issues facing the party in the wake of the by-elections.\"\"Len McCluskey\'s job is to address the issues that are the foremost priorities for Unite\'s members,\" he added.',politics
'Child porn case dropped to prevent FBI disclosure US prosecutors have dropped a case against a man accused of using a child porn site because the government refused to divulge how it revealed his identity. The Playpen site was located on the Tor network which is used to anonymise web-browsing activity. The FBI found a way around this to reveal the users\' real IP addresses and led to 200 prosecutions. But it refused to reveal to the court how it managed the feat. The site was located on the Tor network which many people use to browse the web anonymously. It conceals their location and identity by routing their connections through a chain of different computers and encrypting data in the process. To get round this the FBI used what it called \"network investigative techniques\" and revealed people\'s identities. But it refused a request for information on its technological investigation techniques. Federal prosecutor Annette Hayes on Friday that \"because the government remains unwilling to disclose certain discovery related to the FBI\'s deployment of a \'network investigative technique\'\" it was \"deprived of the evidence needed to establish defendant Jay Michaud\'s guilt beyond reasonable doubt\". The government\'s Motion to Dismiss order is pending before the court and the judge is expected to sign a dismissal order \"within the next day or two\", the assistant public defender Colin Fieman told the BBC. Mr Michaud\'s case is one of many emerging from the investigation into Playpen users. In December, the Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said the investigation of Playpen and the identification or rescue of at least 49 American children who were subject to sexual abuse.

'Jersey scrape into Muratti final in chaotic end in Alderney Jersey narrowly avoided an upset and edged into the Muratti final with a 2-1 win over Alderney, with all three goals in stoppage time in a chaotic ending.

'Has this dress been to more countries than you? \"Made in Morocco\" says the label on the pink Zara shirt dress. While this may be where the garment was finally sewn together, it has already been to several other countries. In fact, it\'s quite possible this piece of clothing is better travelled than you. If it was human, it would have certainly journeyed far enough to have earned itself some decent air miles. The material used to create it came from lyocell - a sustainable alternative to cotton. The trees used to make this fibre come mainly from Europe, according to Lenzing, the Austrian supplier that Zara-owner Inditex uses. These fibres were shipped to Egypt, where they were spun into yarn. This yarn was then sent to China where it was woven into a fabric. This fabric was then sent to Spain where it was dyed, in this case pink. The fabric was then shipped to Morocco to be cut into the various parts of the dress and then sewn together. After this, it was sent back to Spain where it was packaged and then sent to the UK, the US or any one of the 93 countries where Inditex has shops. From dresses to t-shirts and trousers, most items of clothing sold around the world will have had similarly complicated journeys. In fact, they\'re likely to be even more convoluted. Most Inditex garments are made close to its Spanish headquarters or in nearby countries such as Portugal, Morocco and Turkey. This is what helps the firm achieve its famously fast reaction times to new trends. Most of its rivals\' supply chains are far less local. Regardless of where they\'re based, most factories are not owned by the fashion brands that use them. Instead, they\'re selected as official suppliers. Often these suppliers subcontract work to other factories for certain tasks, or in order to meet tight deadlines. This system can make tracking the specific origins of a single item difficult. I contacted several big clothing brands including H&amp; M, Marks and Spencer, Gap and Arcadia Group last week to give me a sample example of the journey of a t-shirt in their basic range from seed to finished product. Only Inditex was able to respond in time to meet the deadline for this article.\"I imagine companies don\'t want to respond because they have no clue where the materials they buy come from,\" says Tim Hunt, a researcher at Ethical Consumer, which researches the social, ethical and environmental behaviour of firms. The difficulties were highlighted devastatingly by where more than 1, 100 people were killed and 2, 500 injured when the Bangladesh garment factory collapsed. In some cases, brands weren\'t even aware their clothes were being produced there. According to the by Christian Aid and development organisation Baptist World Aid Australia, only 16\% of the 87 biggest fashion brands publish a full list of the factories where their clothes are sewn, and less than a fifth of brands know where all of their zips, buttons, thread and fabric come from. Non-profit group Fashion Revolution, formed after the Rana Plaza factory collapse, is leading a campaign to try to force firms to be more transparent about their supply chains. Every year, around the time of the disaster it runs a #whomademyclothes campaign encouraging customers to push firms on this issue. Fashion Revolution co-founder and creative director Orsola de Castro says the mass production demands of the fashion industry and the tight timescales required to get products from the catwalks on to the shelves as quickly as possible means the manufacturing processes have become \"very, very chaotic\".\"The amount of manpower which goes into the production of a t-shirt - even at the sewing level, it goes through so many different hands. On their standard products most brands wouldn\'t know the journey from seed to store,\" she says. While newer and smaller fashion brands are creating products with 100\% traceability, she says it\'s a lot harder for the established giants.\"It\'s a big and complex issue to turn around and would require a massive shift in attitude.\" Yet just over a decade ago, Pietra Rivoli had no problems tracking the journey of a single $6 cotton t-shirt she\'d picked out of a sale bin in a Walmart in Florida. Starting with the tag at the back of the t-shirt, she tracked its journey backwards from the US \"step by step along the supply chain\".\"A shoe leather project,\" is how Prof Rivoli describes her journey, which resulted in a book, The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy. As a teacher of finance and international business at Georgetown University in Washington, Prof Rivoli wanted to investigate her assumption that free trade benefited all countries. Her travels took her from the cotton-growing region of Lubbock in Texas to China, where the t-shirt was sewn together. Eventually, she ended up in Tanzania on the east coast of Africa, which has a thriving second-hand clothing market. Her assumption was that the complicated supply chain was driven by cost and market forces. She concluded that a lot of brands\' decisions about where to buy supplies and make their clothing was actually driven by politics. She cites US agricultural subsidies for cotton growers and China\'s migration policies encouraging workers to move from the countryside as examples. \"Rather than a story of how people were competing - how do I make a faster T-shirt, a better T-shirt, a cheaper T-shirt - what I found is that the story of the T-shirt and why its life turned out the way it did was really about how people were using political power,\" she says. The current backlash against global trade is a direct result of this kind of political interference, she believes. This kind of consumer anger could eventually drive change among fashion firms, she says. Prof Rivoli notes that many firms now list all their direct suppliers and she says there is a move towards developing fewer, longer term supplier relationships.\"There might be a little less hopping around,\" she laughs.',business
'Five ways the singles chart can be fixed Even Ed Sheeran thinks there\'s something wrong with the singles chart. Until last week, no artist had ever had more than four top 10 hits at the same time - but Sheeran smashed that record to pieces, putting nine songs from his new album, Divide, into the top. The main reason for his success is streaming. Tracks from his album were played 110 million times last week on Spotify, Apple Music and their competitors, sending all 16 tracks from Divide into the chart.\"I don\'t know if there\'s some weird thing that Spotify and Apple Music are going to have to change now,\" the star told BBC Radio 1. \"I never expected to have nine songs in the top 10 in my life. I don\'t know if something\'s gone wrong but I\'m definitely very, very happy about it.\"A look at the midweek chart update suggests Ed will continue to overshadow the competition, with six tracks clinging on to their position in the top 10. The record industry is delighted - HMV says the album \"exceeded expectations\", while Sainsbury\'s recorded their biggest week of CD sales since Adele\'s 25.\"The sheer voracity with which it\'s been devoured is just incredible,\" boasted Sheeran\'s record label boss, Ben Cook, in an interview with Music Week. But the star\'s unprecedented one-man takeover of the chart has left people wondering whether the venerable countdown has become redundant. The problem is that, with Ed Sheeran taking up 40\% of the available space, other acts are being pushed out. Last year saw a shockingly low number of new artists making their Top 40 debut. Even this week, the much-anticipated new single from Lorde only managed to score a new entry at 28, even though it was at number 12 in the download chart.\"The charts have changed dramatically in the last five or 10 years,\" Official Chart Company boss Martin Talbot told the BBC. \"We\'re constantly reviewing the way that we count those different ways of consuming, and we will continue to do so.\"Here are some of the ways the charts could be redrawn to fix the Sheeran situation. Redefine what a single is This week, we have the ludicrous situation where 14 of the top 20 singles aren\'t actually singles. They\'re album tracks. It would be pretty easy to exclude all the other songs and bring back a sense of normality to the countdown. But there\'s a problem: if Ed decides to release Galway Girl as a single later down the line, it\'s already been bought and streamed 90, 000 times. It\'s very likely the single would be classified as a \"flop\". Fix the formula At the minute, every time a song is streamed 150 times, it counts as one real-world \"sale\". The Official Charts Company recently upped that ratio from 100: 1, but even that couldn\'t stop Ed\'s chart takeover. Yet, if you look at the , Divide doesn\'t dominate nearly as much. It only accounts for six songs in the top 20, with hits by Rag \'N\' Bone Man and Katy Perry holding on to their positions. The dilemma is that streaming is enjoying exponential rates of growth. Spotify added 10 million customers in the last six months; while Apple Music has attracted 20 million subscribers in less than two years. One quick fix, , would be to impose a cap on individual users. \"Once you hit 150 streams that count as a sale, no more streams from your account count toward the chart,\" he says. Others have suggested the limit should be . Whether or not that\'s viable, the Charts Company needs to be much more nimble, tweaking its formula on a monthly basis to stop streams becoming a flood. Eliminate passive listening By including streaming data, the modern charts reflect what people are listening to, as well as what they buy. In theory, this is great. It eliminates the phenomenon of \"fan club hits\" - where a dedicated group of, say, One Direction fans could send a song to number one on the week of release, only for it to disappear seven days later. On the flipside, you can argue that lots of Ed Sheeran\'s streams came from people who didn\'t even choose to listen to him. A \"passive\" listener, who simply fires up one of Spotify\'s curated playlists is likely to hear Ed\'s music at least once. Its UK Top 50 playlist is dominated by Divide; while Hot Hits UK has three of Sheeran\'s songs in its line-up. If it\'s technically possible (and no-one can quite tell me whether it is or not) passive streams could carry less weight than those generated by a fan typing \"Ed Sheeran Divide\" into the search bar. Include airplay in the charts This is a controversial one. UK radio stations, including BBC Radio 1, have long wanted the charts to reflect what\'s being played on air. It already happens in the US, where radio exposure can send a song into the Billboard Hot 100 long before it becomes popular on streaming services. The figures are carefully weighted to reflect that a song played at 4am won\'t be heard by as many people as one played at 4pm - and that a station with a large audience has more impact than a smaller rival. In the UK, including airplay could give a helping hand to new artists - especially given the role that Radio 2 and Radio 1 play in championing new music. The downside is that commercial radio - with honourable exceptions like Radio X, Kiss and Rinse - is horrifically conservative. A grime artist like Stormzy, who dominated the Top 40 a week before Ed Sheeran, can only struggle to 36th place in this week\'s airplay chart. Ban Ed Sheeran Only kidding. In fact, Ed\'s not even the first person to score multiple new entries off the back of a new album. Beyonce, The Weeknd and Stormzy have all done similar things in the past year - albeit on a smaller scale. And none of the above solutions would satisfactorily address the way big releases overshadow the competition - which gives an idea of the difficulties faced by the Official Charts Company. The question is, can any of the fixes be worse than the current situation? ',entertainment
'\'Don\'t bag up dog poo in countryside\', MP urges owners Dog walkers are being urged not to bag up their pet\'s poo in the countryside - but to use a stick and flick it into the undergrowth instead. Conservative MP Anne Main advocated the method during a Westminster debate as a way of reducing the number of plastic bags blighting the countryside. Mrs Main says better signage is needed at the entrance of parks and open spaces so dog owners know what to do. She said the practice of hanging poo-filled bags from trees was \"rampant\". BBC research found that local authorities in England and Wales received some 73, 824 complaints about dog fouling in 2014-15. Various initiatives have been tried to tackle the problem in urban areas. Mrs Main, MP for St Albans and the owner of a three-year old lakeland jack russell terrier called Sam, says the menace of poo-filled bags in the countryside \"is a massive problem\" that is polluting the environment.\"Like many people, I like to walk my dog out in the countryside, parks and in woodland, but over the last few years I\'ve noticed an increasing number of dog poo bags hanging off bushes, trees and railings - and it\'s disgusting,\" she said.\"People think it\'s the right thing to do to pick it up, but when they find there aren\'t any bins, they jettison the poo-bag into the undergrowth or lob it over a garden fence where animals can eat them, children pick them up or cyclists ride into them.\"Mrs Main, who raised the issue during a Westminster Hall debate on Tuesday, says many dog walkers start off with the best intentions, by leaving a bag in a tree on a track to pick up on the way home - but then forget to collect it.\"We have to work with human nature,\" she said. \"People are not going to carry a dollop of dog poo on a three hour walk - and you are not going to find a bin in Ashdown Forest.\'Poo strategy\' She hopes ministers will press for better signage at the entrance to forest areas and parks with advice on dog poo disposal. She also thinks the Forestry Commission-backed campaign for dog walkers to use a \"stick and flick\" the mess off the pathway and into the undergrowth, or cover it with leaves, is a more effective way of removing the mess. Keep Britain Tidy estimates there are more than eight million dogs in the UK producing more than 1, 000 tonnes of mess every day. Speaking during Tuesday\'s debate, Ms Main called for a \"pragmatic poo strategy\", suggesting the amount of dog excrement produced every year was equivalent to the weight of the Empire State Building in New York and five times that of St Paul\'s Cathedral. She acknowledged the situation was different in Scotland - - but said consideration should be given to revising the Scottish Outdoor Access Code to give added protection to farm and wild animals. Responding for the government, Communities minister Marcus Jones said the majority of dog owners were very careful and cleared up after their pets but a \"small minority\" were either irresponsible or ignorant about the risks of failing to do so.\"We should be absolutely clear,\" he said. \"This is disgusting, anti-social and dangerous to human health and other animals. We should at every turn encourage people to act responsibly, pick up after them and if there is no bin take it home.\"He said different approaches are being tried out in other areas, including the launch of poo bag dispensers in Aberdeen - and a £100 fine for dog walkers failing to carry poo bags in Stoke. While there has been a reduction in dog fouling in recent years, a recent survey of more than 10, 000 sites found dog mess left in 7\% of places. Anyone who fails to clear up after their dog can be issued with a fixed penalty notice. If the case goes to court, this could cost the owner or person in charge of the animal up to £1, 000. The Dogs Trust advises dog owners to use public litter bins to dispose of dog mess when there are no specific dog waste bins available. ',politics
'MWC 2017: Sony launches slow-mo Xperia XZ Premium phone Sony\'s latest smartphone is capable of filming smooth slow-motion footage at four times the rate possible on Apple and Samsung\'s top-end models. The Xperia XZ Premium captures video at up to 960 frames per second (fps). The achievement was made possible by a new type of image sensor that has built-in memory of its own. Sony\'s smartphone market share is small, but it usually makes its sensors available to rivals about six to 12 months after they debut. Apple, Samsung, LG and Xiaomi are among those to have used its technology in recent handsets. The new phone was unveiled alongside several lower specification devices on the first day of the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona. \"Despite this being one of the best devices at MWC, I don\'t see it changing Sony\'s fortunes,\" commented Francisco Jeronimo, from the market research firm IDC.\"If you go through Sony\'s financial statements you can see it now makes more money from selling phone cameras to its competitors than selling its own smartphones, which is quite remarkable\"So, its phones are a way to show off its capabilities, and the new camera is outstanding - not just the slow-mo but also the picture quality.\"Sony shipped about half as many smartphones in 2016 as the previous year and has about 1\% share of the market, according to IDC, putting it in 17th place. More from MWC 2017: Sony calls the new technology Motion Eye. It uses a three-layer stacked sensor fitted with one gigabit of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Doing so lets the component temporarily store a rapid burst of video data locally before it is transferred to other memory components, which takes more time. When the firm earlier this month it said it was capable of 1, 000 fps in 1080p \"full high definition\". However, on the Xperia XZ Premium it has been restricted to slightly fewer frames per second at 720p resolution. In practice, users can only capture 0. 18 seconds of footage at this speed, which produces six seconds of video when played back. But they can do so in the middle of filming normal footage to create a slow-down-and-speed-back-up effect. The challenge is to press the button at the right moment.\"It\'s only a very brief amount of time and you\'ve got to be really on the ball to use it effectively,\" commented Tim Coulling from the Canalys tech consultancy.\"But it\'s a great feature.\"The built-in DRAM memory also lets users record action that happened a second before they pressed the record button. This buffer function is intended to help them avoid missed moments, but only works if the device detects motion, which triggers the facility. Other unusual features include: a 5. 5in (14cm) 4K resolution display that has four times as many pixels as 1080p equivalents. It also plays back Amazon Prime Video content in high dynamic range. HDR delivers more vibrant images that reveal extra detail compared to traditional footage the choice of a mirrored body. This allows the back of the device to be used to help put on make-up or put in contact lenses. However, it also attracts fingerprint marks Smart projector Analysts were less positive about another of the Japanese firm\'s announcements. Sony confirmed its Xperia Touch projector would go on sale later \"this Spring\". The Android-powered device was first teased at last year\'s MWC. The machine uses ultrashort-throw projection technology to display apps on a nearby wall or table. The resulting 720p image can be configured to be between 23in to 80in (58. 4cm to 203. 2cm) in size. Built-in sensors let the surface used act like a large touchscreen. Sony says it expects families to \"huddle\" around the image when using it, and showed the BBC a multiplayer game where several players interacted with graphics projected onto a table at once. The machine is designed to be used while connected to a power source, but can work for up to an hour unplugged. A potential problem, however, is its price: Sony plans to charge €1, 499 ($1, 584; £1, 269) when it goes on sale in Europe and Japan.\"I think Sony should be applauded for being bold enough to push into a new category, but unfortunately it\'s out of reach to all but the most affluent gadget addicts,\" commented Ben Wood from CCS Insight. Mr Jeronimo was more harsh in his criticism.\"It\'s a huge mistake,\" he said.\"If Sony combined a projector with a device like the Amazon Echo or Google Home for a third of the price, that would be a very interesting. \"But asking for more than $1, 500 - there\'s no way they will sell them.\"',tech
'France v Wales: Six Nations officials to review incidents at end of game Six Nations officials are reviewing events in the closing stages of including an alleged bite on wing George North. Wales coach Rob Howley was left to \"question the integrity of our game\" after France replaced Uini Atonio with Rabah Slimani during the 20 minutes of added time that were played. France\'s team doctor said Atonio needed to go off for a head injury assessment. North, meanwhile, said he was bitten in the build-up to France\'s final try. Referee Wayne Barnes asked television match official Peter Fitzgibbon to check the incident, but he could not find any clear footage so the game resumed without action being taken. Six Nations Rugby said an independent citing commissioner would review \"all relevant incidents\" and raise any issues in due course, normally within 48 hours of the end of the match. It added it was \"aware of concerns\" about the head injury assessment in added time and \"is looking into the matter\". Speaking after Saturday\'s game, Howley said: \"In terms of the process, I think we have reason to complain.\"You can hear Wayne Barnes ask him if he is OK. He said he had a sore back, but that he was OK. And then the doctor comes on, and he goes off.\"I\'ve no issues about the result, it\'s just about the process.\"France coach Guy Noves said his medical staff told him Atonio was injured. He added: \"We will do a medical check-up. I hope the injury is not too serious, and he will be able to play again soon.\"Wales led 18-13 at the end of the 80 minutes but Damien Chouly drove over for the try that brought France level, and Camille Lopez\'s conversion was decisive.

'How fake data could lead to failed crops and other woes There\'s a new cyber threat on the horizon. And it\'s fiendishly subtle and potentially very dangerous. Fake data - altering databases and documents without anyone noticing. Say you changed centrally held figures for a key metric such as soil fertility that many arable farmers use to organise their planting schedules.\"That data is used to drive another process, and lots of decisions are made on that basis,\" says Jason Hart from security firm Gemalto. Unless the attack was noticed quickly, he says, it could have devastating consequences because the sabotaged data would kick off actions that played out over months and years. You could end up with failed crops, food shortages and, in a worst case scenario, famine. \"You have no way of going back once a decision is made and the impact has happened,\" says Mr Hart. \"There\'s a real amplifier effect to that kind of problem.\" Other scenarios include hackers interfering with automated stock market trading, triggering mass sell-offs and economic instability. Or \"poisoning\" supply chain data so that the wrong stuff goes to the wrong stores, not to mention the potential dangers to energy supplies if production forecasts are tampered with. Circle of trust Many of the decisions we make in business and government are based on data that we assume is accurate. So if you undermine the authenticity of that data - and our trust in it - you can potentially bring an economy to its knees, experts warn. Businesses are vulnerable to this type of cyber sabotage because they inherently trust the data and documents they produce, says Abe Smith of Dealflo, a company that helps financial firms automate transactions. \"There\'s about $15 trillion [£12tn] of financial agreements processed every year and most of them are manual in one sense or other,\" says Mr Smith. Automation helped to cut costs involved with those financial agreements and to weed out mistakes, but these changes only reinforced reliance on digital information. And anything digital can be tampered with. Documents that teams have been collaborating on are vulnerable to attackers that can change the core text, alter numbers, or re-write terms and conditions to one party\'s benefit, says John Safa of Pushfor, a company that makes secure ways for firms to share data and other content.\"At the end of the day it can be edited and it can be changed,\" he says. \"The problem then is if it is a legal contract without enough back-up, then it could be represented as something factual.\" It is still all too easy to drill down into a document\'s metadata and change its basic properties that, if examined, lend weight to the fiction of it being authentic.\"Whatever emerges at the other end of a workflow system people will accept,\" he says. \"The document preserves the memory and we believe what it says all the time.\"Trust in all of this process is critical,\" he says. \"If that trust is lost then the entire process breaks down.\"Locked down But there are technical ways to lock down data and documents to thwart the efforts of stealthy attackers to read or change them. Many firms now use Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems to police who can do what to reports, files and other documents floating around their organisations, says Stuart Barr, chief strategy officer at workflow system firm HighQ. DRM has been used to stop pirates stealing copies of copyright movies and video games, he says, but is now regularly applied to documents. It restricts editing to a select few and resists other attempts to make changes. \"You should not be able to fiddle with them,\" he says. It\'s one of the reasons why as a way to authenticate contracts and transactions. Mr Barr says firms using DRM have to strike a balance between putting good protections around valuable documents, and not making them so onerous that people avoid them.\"You would be surprised how many people let documents run around in the wild without any protection,\" he tells the BBC, adding that a lot of organisations are \"porous\", letting key files flow back and forth with few checks on what has happened to them in the meantime. Some firms seek to filter this flow using specialist cloud-based services, but, says Mr Barr, work has to be done to ensure that this innovation does not introduce more risk.\"If they have files that are stored in any reputable cloud they should be encrypted at rest and in transit,\" he says. Scrambling data, allied to techniques that generate unique identifiers for important files, could go a long way towards preventing attacks on data integrity, he says.\"There\'s a growing awareness that this is an issue that has to be taken seriously.\"Error correction Cloud-based management systems that use encryption to protect important documents are still very new in the legal world, says Susan Hall, a partner at law firm Clarke Willmott. A lot of law firms still rely on Redline editing, she says, which uses the edit tracking systems built in to Microsoft Word. This allows edits to be made and marked on versions of contracts and other documents as negotiations or talks progress, she says. \"Often you have junior staff go through the final version to make sure nothing has crept in inadvertently or has otherwise changed before the signature,\" she says.\"But in a lot of these situations you are operating under extreme pressure and there\'s a high risk that people won\'t pick up that something should have been included but wasn\'t.\"In highly complex business contracts, a surreptitiously included clause could end up losing your business millions. So it\'s not just cyber theft we need to worry about, it\'s data integrity. Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on and ',business
'Oscars: Moonlight warms up with Independent Spirit Awards win The cast and creators of Moonlight have warmed up for Sunday\'s Oscars by winning the top prize at Saturday\'s Independent Spirit Awards. The touching and beautifully-shot drama about growing up gay and black in Miami is seen as an outside bet to upset the La La Land bandwagon at the Oscars. It confirmed its status as the awards circuit\'s second favourite film with six Independent Spirit Awards. La La Land wasn\'t eligible for the awards, which reward low-budget films. Moonlight was made for $1. 5m (£1. 2m) over 25 days - but has now recouped $21. 5m (£17. 3m) at the North American box office. It also has eight Oscar nominations, compared with La La Land\'s 14. Key Independent Spirit Awards winners Best feature - Moonlight Best female lead - Isabelle Huppert, Elle Best male lead - Casey Affleck, Manchester By The Sea Best supporting female - Molly Shannon, Other People Best supporting male - Ben Foster, Hell Or High Water Best director - Barry Jenkins, Moonlight Best screenplay - Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney, Moonlight In his acceptance speech, Casey Affleck, who won best male lead, gave a taste of the political tone that is likely to dominate the Oscars. He told the ceremony: \"The policies of this administration are abhorrent and they will not last. They\'re really un-American. \"I know this feels preachy and boring and I\'m preaching to the choir but I\'m just lending my little voice to the chorus here.\" British actress Naomie Harris, who appears in Moonlight, said the current political climate is \"definitely going to be reflected\" at the Oscars.\"Really great art reflects society,\" she told BBC News. \"It also edifies us. It shows us a different way of operating. So I definitely think it\'s going to be a very political year this year at the Oscars.\"She also said Moonlight has struck a chord because it has fed \"our universal yearning for connection\". She said: \"We\'re all yearning to connect, and I think in a society where we have so much technology that makes us feel as though we\'re connected, but it\'s not really about true connection. It\'s not heartfelt connection.\"And that\'s what we\'re all longing for, and I think that, in Moonlight, is what\'s demonstrated.\"The Independent Spirits ceremony is the traditional precursor to the Oscars and is one of the awards season\'s more informal events.

'MP warns of housing strain caused by holiday lets Illegal sub-letters and property magnates are taking advantage of Airbnb and similar-style sites to rake in tax-free cash, an MP says. Labour\'s Karen Buck said renting out properties for short holiday lets can produce up to three times the income of more traditional flat rentals. Growth in the industry is also contributing to a loss of residential accommodation, she told the Commons. She wants the 90-day limit for renting out homes each year to be enforced. Ms Buck says the sharing phenomenon is putting a strain on housing stock, neighbours and cash-strapped councils that are having to deal with anti-social behaviour arising from noise and waste issues, over-crowding and a whole range of other forms of disturbance. Since 2015, numbers of short-term lets have risen by 126\% in London, with Edinburgh, Manchester, Brighton and Bristol following the trend, she said. While most people renting out their homes are aware of their legal responsibilities, are considerate of neighbours, and are simply doing it to \"earn a bit of extra cash\" - there are the \"irresponsible ones - illegal sub-letters, and an increasingly significant commercial operation, seeking to take advantage of potentially higher yields,\" she warned. Short lets can bring in up to three times the income of more traditional flat rentals. According to Westminster Council a two-bed flat can earn £1, 800 a week, compared with £620 for a short hold tenancy, she said.\"The potential to earn more from short lets is a key selling point on some of the sites.\" Ms Buck said one constituent, whose neighbour rents out their flat on a short term let breaching insurance and lease, told her: \"I really hate the idea of our house turning into a hotel, our front door key in a stranger\'s hand.,\"Outlining her ten minute rule bill, Ms Buck said: \"While I welcome the freedom for homeowners to let their properties for such purposes without excessive bureaucratic interference, it is difficult and expensive for cash-strapped councils to police the rules.\"Proving a property is let for more than three months in a year is labour intensive, expensive, and cumbersome for enforcement officers, she said. Ms Buck went on: \"What I believe is now necessary and what this short Bill aims to do is to introduce a light-touch online notification system that is mandatory for homeowners to complete, merely confirming the dates their property is to be used for short-letting.\"It is not asking permission, it is merely allowing local authorities to know where short and holiday lets are taking place so they are able to effectively enforce.\"By all means encourage people to make good use of their homes and extra cash but let\'s make sure this doesn\'t intensify the housing crisis, land costs on others while sharing none of the rewards, and inflict misery on long-term residents who, to their shock, can find themselves waking up in a hotel annexe but after all the hotel caretakers have gone home.\"Ms Buck was allowed to bring in the Short and Holiday Let Accommodation (Notification of Local Authorities) Bill, which has cross-party support, and asked for it to be given a second reading on 24 March.

'Intel buys driverless car technology firm Mobileye US chipmaker Intel is taking a big bet on driverless cars with a $15. 3bn (£12. 5bn) takeover of specialist Mobileye. Intel will pay $63. 54 a share in cash for the Israeli company, which develops \"autonomous driving\" systems. Mobileye and Intel are already working together, along with German carmaker BMW, to put 40 test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. Intel expects the driverless market to be worth as much as $70bn by 2030. Jerusalem-based Mobileye has contracts with 27 car makers. It also controls about two thirds of the market for software that runs automatic emergency braking and semi-autonomous cruise control systems already fitted to cars and trucks. Technology companies are racing to launch driverless cars. Earlier this month, Nissan test drove a converted Leaf vehicle and said it hoped to make the cars available by 2020. Google has also done extensive development of driverless cars. Announcing the deal, Intel said that as cars \"progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels\". The chipmaker reckons that by 2020 driverless cars will generate 4, 000 GB, or 4 terabytes, of data a day that can be mined for information. Betsy Van Hees, analyst at Loop Capital Markets, said Intel had very little presence in the automotive market, \"so this is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities\". Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University academic, said: \"Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution.\"Shares in Intel fell 2. 2\% to $35. 10 in New York. Mobileye was founded in 1999 to develop \"vision-based systems to improve on-road safety and reduce collisions\". The company, along with Intel\'s automated driving group, will be based in Israel and led by Amnon Shashua, Mobileye\'s co-founder, chairman and chief technology officer. In its results for last year, Mobileye said revenue more than tripled to $358m, while pre-tax profit jumped from $79. 7m to $125. 4m.',tech
'Nigeria friendly with Burkina Faso cancelled Nigeria\'s friendly with Burkina Faso on Monday in London has been called off after several Burkina Faso players failed to gain visas to enter the UK. According to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) \"seven players in the Burkinabe contingent failed to secure entry visas into the United Kingdom\". The match was scheduled as part of Nigeria\'s build-up for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against South Africa in June and the World Cup qualifier against Cameroon later in the year. \"The match in question is called off due to no fault of either the organisers or the Nigeria Football Federation. We will announce further plans for the Super Eagles\' preparation for these two important qualifying campaigns in due course,\" top NFF official Chris Green said. The Super Eagles drew 1-1 with Senegal on Thursday night after Kelechi Iheanacho\'s late penalty cancelled out Moussa Sow\'s opening goal at the Hive, home of English fourth tier side Barnet. The NFF say they are \"extremely disappointed\" the match on Monday has been called off but insist that the \"objectives of satisfying the technical team\'s desire of squaring up against tough, physical African opposition and fostering team bonding and organisation were achieved\".\"There is no British Embassy in Ouagadougou, and officials of the Federation Burkinabe de Football had been shuttling between Accra and Ouagadougou for visa processing,\" the NFF explained in a statement.\"FBF (Burkina Faso Football Federation) sources said the Embassy in Accra told them last week to proceed to Morocco (where The Stallions played the Atlas Lions on Friday) and that the visas would be issued there.\"However, the applications were still pending at the British Embassy in Morocco as at close of work on Friday, the last working day before match day in London. \"The Burkinabe Football Federation - on Friday 24 March 2017 by 7pm UK time - telephoned the match organisers [Eurodata] to say some of their players and officials were unable to secure entry visas into the United Kingdom and therefore would not be able to honour the match.\"Three-time African champions Nigeria have failed to qualify for the last two editions of the Africa Cup of Nations.

'Comma comeuppance: When rogue punctuation proves costly A US dairy faces an overtime bill of about $10m (£8m), after a group of truck drivers won a pay dispute that hinged on some punctuation. An appeal court sided with the drivers, saying the lack of a comma in the state of Maine\'s overtime laws made the regulations too ambiguous. The ruling has been branded \"profoundly nerdy\" , while says it \"will delight grammar nerds and Oxford comma enthusiasts anywhere\". So how did it happen? Well, Maine\'s law says the following activities do not qualify for overtime pay: \"The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of: (1) Agricultural produce; (2) Meat and fish products; and (3) Perishable foods.\"The drivers said the lack of a comma between \"shipment\" and \"or distribution\" meant the legislation applied only to the single activity of \"packing\", rather than to \"packing\" and \"distribution\" as two separate activities. And because drivers distribute the goods, but do not pack them, they argued they were therefore eligible for overtime pay - backdated over several years. A district court had earlier ruled in favour of the dairy firm. But circuit judge David J Barron overturned that, writing: \"We conclude that the exemption\'s scope is actually not so clear in this regard. \"And because, under Maine law, ambiguities in the state\'s wage and hour laws must be construed liberally in order to accomplish their remedial purpose, we adopt the drivers\' narrower reading of the exemption.\"Their employer, Oakhurst Dairy, is likely to appeal. But if it were to ultimately lose, it would not be the first business to fall foul of punctuation problems, spelling mistakes and typos. The misplaced comma When US defence giant Lockheed Martin signed a deal to build Hercules military transport aircraft for an unnamed air force, it knew manufacturing would take several years. So the contract it drew up in 1999 stated that the price of the planes would increase over time, to account for inflation. Unfortunately the formula used to work out the price of the aircraft had a typo: a comma that was one decimal place out. A senior Lockheed executive at the time was quoted as saying: But before we feel too sorry for the firm, in the previous year it had reported total profits of about $1bn. The mispriced share deal In December 2005, stock market trading in a newly listed Japanese company Shares in J-Com plunged after the broker at Mizuho Securities tried to sell 610, 000 shares at 1 yen each. They had meant to sell one share for 610, 000 yen. A fault at the Tokyo Stock Exchange meant the deal could not be reversed, costing Mizuho about 40bn yen (worth $333m or £190m at the time).

'Scots funding guarantee for EU students extended by a year Students from other EU countries who start courses in Scotland next year will still get free tuition, the Scottish government has announced. Students had sought reassurances in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. The government previously guaranteed funding on courses starting in 2017/18, and a further year has now been added. Education Secretary John Swinney said students \"rightly have concerns\", and said he was \"delighted\" to give them reassurance. EU students are entitled to free university tuition on the same terms as Scots. It is how this will be affected in the longer term by Brexit, but the government has to students starting courses in the interim. Mr Swinney made the announcement, extending the guarantee to courses starting in the 2018/19 academic year, during a visit to the University of Dundee. He said it was important to reassure students who will be in the middle of their courses as the UK leaves the EU. He said: \"I am proud that Scotland is a destination of choice for EU students and I am delighted to give them further reassurance.\"EU students will rightly have concerns about any change in their status half way through a course. These students deserve certainty and knowing that their free tuition is in place for the entirety of their course is important.\"The move affects nationals of other EU countries, including the Republic of Ireland, who plan to study for the whole of their degree at a Scottish university - not exchange students who come to Scotland for a few months as part of their course. Typically a student who starts next year would graduate in 2022 - the expectation is that Britain will leave the EU in 2019.\'Huge importance\' Universities Scotland director Alastair Sim said the move was \"both welcoming and assuring for then sector\", adding: \"EU students are of huge importance to Scotland and its universities: educationally, culturally, economically and as a core part of many important courses. \"It\'s right that the Scottish government have given clarity for students who will be thinking about choosing Scotland to learn, study and contribute.\"The Scottish Conservatives also welcomed the move. Education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: \"Students - and indeed staff - from the EU make a very significant contribution to our higher and further education institutions.\"While everyone recognises the complexities of the Brexit negotiations, I hope the UK government will soon be in a position to give similar guarantees.\"Labour\'s education spokesman Iain Gray added: \"EU students make a valuable contribution to Scotland\'s education system, economy and cultural life.

'YouTube takes on cable with new TV service YouTube has launched a $35-a-month TV subscription service that will rival US cable networks.

There are already other streaming cable services offering so-called \"skinny bundles\" of a few main channels at a cheaper cost compared to a traditional cable TV package. Most notably, DirectTV - owned by AT&amp; T - offers more than 120 channels over the internet, but its cost - $70 per month - is considerably higher. DirectTV has also come in for fierce criticism over stability. At the beginning of this month, the service went down at perhaps the worst moment imaginable - viewers missed the end of the Super Bowl, and perhaps the most dramatic moment in US sports in recent memory. Google\'s vast infrastructure and expertise could give them an edge, predicted eMarketer\'s Mr Verna.\"YouTube has the technical know how and infrastructure but it\'s never a given that things will go right. It\'s not just about delivering the technology at scale. \"It\'s about the user interface - and that\'s something YouTube has never been particularly good at.\"',tech
'Super League: Huddersfield Giants 12-28 Leeds Rhinos Leeds Rhinos recorded their third straight Super League win, at the expense of West Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield Giants. It was a tight first half at 18-12 despite Leeds outscoring Giants four tries to two, as Ashton Golding added just one goal to those scores. Danny Brough and Carl Ablett were sin-binned for a scuffle after the break. Jordan Baldwinson\'s late try was a rare bright spot in a scruffy second 40 that saw Giants kept scoreless. Brian McDermott\'s Leeds were mauled but the response ever since has been excellent, and they exuded confidence in attack and defence to end the Giants\' three-game derby winning streak. For Rick Stone there will be frustration the Giants could not turn some of their possession into points in a dogged second period, and they have lost three of the past four games. The visitors made a bright start when wingers Tom Briscoe and Ryan Hall notched a try apiece to go 10-0 ahead but Ukuma Ta\'ai and Jermaine McGillvary tries put the Giants in front. It was the only time the hosts would lead as Leeds responded when Ablett and Matt Parcell\'s scores restored the lead. The sin-binning summed up the second period, which was a combination of Leeds\' defence, Giants\' inability to execute and far too many errors. Baldwinson\'s late score on the back of Golding and Liam Sutcliffe penalty goals gave Leeds\' travelling support extra cheer and the score-line a slightly flattering look.\"It\'s a disappointment, we were in the contest for the majority of the game. We started a little bit slow but we got on even terms.\"The Danny Brough sin-bin didn\'t help our cause. I thought there were some tries there if we could hang on to the ball but we made 10 second-half errors which makes it tough to win matches. We didn\'t give ourselves a chance.\"In the last 20 minutes we defended our line really strongly and Leeds gave us some respect by kicking a couple of penalty goals. They managed the game better than us at the crucial times.\"\"We\'ll savour that. It\'s a decent position to be in but I don\'t think we\'re rolling our shoulders at being there after the last 18 months. We\'ve a big one at our place next Friday against Wigan. \"It was an ugly game for both teams. I don\'t think anybody enjoyed it. I won\'t be too down about it, though. We got penalised a lot in the first half and that takes so much juice out of you. I don\'t think we got any rhythm or momentum back and the game became a scrappy, stop-start affair.\"They probably let us off the hook with their finishing but I suppose we were just good enough defensively to come away with the win. We weren\'t as good with the ball as last week but it\'s good that we can defend our way to a win.\" McIntosh; McGillvary, Cudjoe, Mellor, Murphy; Brough, Gaskell; Rapira, Leeming, Ikahihifo, Ferguson, Ta\'ai, Clough Hinchcliffe, Wakeman, Roberts, Smith Golding; T.

'Balfour Beatty returns to profit UK engineering giant Balfour Beatty has returned to profit after two years of losses. The company behind Crossrail and the transformation of the former Olympic Stadium into West Ham\'s ground made an £8m profit, after a £199m loss in 2015. Balfour said it had allowed its business to become too complex after a series of takeovers. Chief executive Leo Quinn said the company\'s leadership, processes and controls had been upgraded. \"The transformation of Balfour Beatty is well under way,\" he said. High profile projects The company said that, by 2014, it had become overly complex following more than a decade of acquisition-led growth. It added there had been an overall lack of leadership and strategic direction, and that its businesses had a tendency to compete with each other. However, Balfour says its business has now been simplified. The company is involved in some of the country\'s highest profile building projects. As well as Crossrail, which will link west and east London, it is upgrading motorways and working on the Thames Tideway Tunnel. In the next few years it plans to be part of the country\'s three biggest infrastructure projects: High Speed 2 (HS2), the new nuclear power stations at Hinkley Point C and Wylfa, and the third runway at Heathrow airport.\'Reasonable foundations\' Analysts have been encouraged by the company\'s progress. \"The self-help phase of the turnaround plan has restored the group to reasonable foundations, with the all-important construction division back in profit in the second half,\" said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\"The strategy now calls for the group to rebuild margins towards something close to industry standard - at around 2\% it\'s not an overly ambitious target on the face of it, but something Balfour have failed to achieve for some time,\" he said. Balfour said it was upbeat about prospects as the \"trading environment in the group\'s core UK and US markets remains positive\".\"In the UK, government policy is helping to drive a strong pipeline of major infrastructure projects in transport and energy.\"In the US, the new administration has made infrastructure one of its key priorities.\" ',business
'Geri Horner: Why my son is named after George Michael It\'s 20 years since Geri Horner (then Halliwell) strode onto the Brits stage in her Union Jack dress in one of the defining images of the 1990s. To mark the anniversary, the singer is hosting a BBC Two documentary on the decade, looking at her own journey from Turkish game show host to globe-straddling, Nelson Mandela-cuddling pop phenomenon. It\'s called Geri\'s 1990s: My Drive to Freedom - referring to the 1967 open-topped sports car she bought with her first \"fat pay cheque\" from Virgin Records. Ahead of the broadcast this Saturday, the star sat down with BBC News to reflect on the decade that changed her life. Along the way, she reveals the creative tensions that split up the Spice Girls, her time as a Turkish TV show hostess, and why she named her newborn son after George Michael. It was a really good reminder of how much influence that decade had on my life. It was brilliant in every way - musically, culturally, politically. There was so much colour and creativity. Britain felt like the centre of the universe at that moment. Yes, I had a little scare. []I think it was something else that put the petrol in my tank. I was always ambitious, but my dad died when I was quite young. He\'d always been very encouraging of my career, and when he died not only did I experience the loss of a parent, but also my own mortality. You suddenly think: \"Oh God, life\'s here and you\'ve just got to go for it\". That, for me, was a defining moment. Two things happened: I went back to college to study English Literature - but to subsidise that, I had to take lots of little jobs. One of them, I was a . The show was a bit like The Price is Right, and I would go to Turkey and do that. I had all these random jobs, but what they ultimately were for, was to fund me going into the studio. I remember the guy said it would cost £300 to get my demo tape together. I\'d written one song myself and the other was a cover of the song . It was called Live to Love. It was pretty crap. Oh, I\'d tried loads and loads of different things. All sorts of random stuff. And there were some dodgy things, believe me. When you\'re in the middle of it, you just sort of get on with it. I liked being part of a group. The camaraderie. It was a lot of fun. What you think about something and what it turns out to be is never going to be quite the same. Some bits are better, some bits are not. But it was a very happy, fun, full-on experience. Twenty years ago, if you said the word feminism, you thought of those bra-burning, marching protestors. It was quite tough and harsh. For me, Girl Power was a much more punchy way of saying it. But actually, Girl Power embodies much more than a gender. It\'s about everybody. Everybody deserves the same treatment, whatever race you are, gender you are, age you are. Everybody deserves a voice. It was just saying that in a very digestible way. Oh, I saw that, when I told the bloke to zip it! Do you know what? I didn\'t actually take that very personally. Sometimes people just need reminding that we have to be respectful. He\'s just being a bit silly. He needs reminding what\'s what. I feel incredibly proud to have been part of the writing. I\'ve always loved lyric-writing, and melodies - so if it gets recognised, fantastic. I\'m proud of my solo album - the first one I did - because it was so honest. If you listen to , I was really inspired by the Carpenters. On the bridge, where I sing \"it\'s going to be alright\", I was trying to the way Karen\'s voice would go really low and then soar up again. But then I also love . It\'s a very confident song. Really fight for it. Nobody wanted it. The record company didn\'t want it. Management didn\'t want it. And I can understand the hesitation. It was not the coolest. But the best song to me is when you instinctively like it - not because it\'s cool, not because it\'s what the latest fad is. You just connect to it. And we always knew it could only ever be that way round. I had faith in it and Emma had faith in it. Erm… Would I have left? It depends. They wanted to make an R&amp; B album. Am I a big R&amp; B fan? Not really. I\'m a pop writer. I felt comfortable in that genre and it felt completely alien to me to sing in that R&amp; B style. My departure almost set them free a bit, and allowed them to make that album [Forever, recorded with Rodney Jerkins]. So I don\'t regret it. Part of life is change. I always had sort of a crush on him, so when I met him I just thought, \"wow!\". Most of all, I admired him as an artist, for his music but also, I just think he was a really kind, good person. I filmed the documentary before he died - but I talk about him, and now that [section] has become really sad and poignant. He was just such a generous, kind, loving being. Yeah, it was my mother\'s idea. Because she was very fond of George and he really loved my mum. He went to her wedding! I had a month [of pregnancy] to go after George died and when Monty was born, mum said, \"why don\'t you give him George\'s name?\". And I thought, \"oh that\'s really sweet.\"I tell you what - it puts it all in perspective. You realise how lucky we are to live in a country like this. We have an NHS - I know we complain about it, but we have one. We have a support system for the unemployed. There is a structure here that supports. And there is a freedom that some countries do not have. Yeah! You\'ve really done your research! Actually, they just called me in for a chat. They didn\'t give me the part. I don\'t think I was up their street. Oh my God, that was amazing. That was amazing! I had to properly audition for it. They were very strict, because it was all about comedy timing and very tightly scripted. But I think I got more kudos from doing that than anything else. My girlfriends were so excited I was in that. I wrote the majority of the album when I was pregnant and it\'s really coming together now. Do you know what? I felt this surge of creativity when I was pregnant. And you\'re much more emotional - my feelings were really on tap. But this album - it\'s just so different. I feel like I\'ve jumped over to the other side. When you\'re a certain genre, like the pop genre, it\'s like being 12 and to get to the other side, to grow up and be comfortable, has taken me a while. But I feel like I\'ve finally done it. I\'m really, really hopeful that it\'s this side of the summer. That would be really nice. I\'d be really happy to share it. ',entertainment
'Michelle O\'Neill calls for \'urgent\' referendum on Irish unity Sinn Féin has renewed its call for a referendum on Irish unity \"as soon as possible\". Its northern leader, Michelle O\'Neill, said the urgency was increased by the prospect of Brexit, which would be \"a disaster for the people of Ireland\". She was speaking shortly after said she was to seek a second referendum on independence. Mrs O\'Neill said this was \"a matter for the Scottish people\". Referring to Irish unity, the Sinn Féin MLA said it was now \"over to the people to have their say in relation to the future\". She was speaking during a break from talks at Stormont aimed at restoring the power-sharing executive. MLAs have been attending a ceremony at Parliament Buildings to sign the roll of membership. They were due to elect a new speaker, but this has been postponed for two weeks. The Northern Ireland Secretary, James Brokenshire, has cancelled a planned trip to the United States this week to concentrate on the Stormont talks. Mr Brokenshire had been due to travel to Washington on Wednesday for two days. He was due to meet President Trump as part of St Patrick\'s Day celebrations. Talks at Stormont are a \"critical stage\" and his focus is with them, a senior government source told the Press Association. \"He is just focused on getting the right result and getting an agreement by 27 March,\" said the source. \"The deadline is looming. He will have no other option by law but to call another election if there is no agreement by then.\" On Thursday, Mr Brokenshire warned there could be if the discussions to try to restore power sharing end in deadlock. If Northern Ireland\'s parties fail to reach a deal by 27 March, voters face the prospect of going back to the polls for a second snap election within months.

Mr McGuinness resigned over Mrs Foster\'s refusal to step aside as first minister pending an inquiry into the which was set up under her watch as Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and could cost the Northern Ireland tax payer £490m. The election saw an end to the unionist majority at Stormont, with Sinn Féin now holding just one seat fewer than the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). If no executive is formed, another election can be called, and ultimately power could return to the UK parliament at Westminster for the first time in a decade.',politics

'Why high-flying Singapore wants more than grades It was no accident that Singapore created one of the world\'s highest performing education systems in five decades. Reminiscent of the examinations for selecting mandarins in old China, the road to success in Singapore has always been focused on academic credentials, based on merit and allowing equal access for all. This centralised system helped Singapore to create social cohesion, a unity of purpose among its schools and an ethos of hard work that many nations envy. But the purpose of the education system has changed and Singapore in 2017 is no longer the fledgling state it was in 1965. Schools have become highly stratified and competitive. More advantaged families are better able to support their children with extra lessons outside of school, such as enrichment classes in mathematics, English, dance and music. Those who can\'t afford this have to depend on their children\'s own motivation and the resources of the school to catch up. This social divide continues to widen because the policies that had won the system its accolades - based on the principle of meritocracy - no longer support the social mobility they were meant to bring about. So work is in progress to tackle anything in the system that seems to be working against social cohesion. This time around, it will no longer be enough to develop a highly-skilled workforce to plug into the global economy. More stories from the looking at education from an international perspective, and . You can join the debate at the . The next update of the education system will have to ensure that Singapore can create a more equitable society, build a stronger social compact among its people while at the same time develop capabilities for the new digital economy. Government policies are moving away from parents and students\' unhealthy obsession with grades and entry to top schools and want to put more emphasis on the importance of values. Schools have been encouraged, especially for the early elementary years, to scrap standardised examinations and focus on the development of the whole child. \"Character scorecards\" and \"reflection journals\" have become the staple in many primary schools, to allow parents to follow the social and developmental progress of their children. A number of schools have also adopted an approach centred on well-being, as promulgated by Dr Martin Seligman, director of the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. Dr Seligman\'s model advocates that academic success and well-being form a double helix, and that the best schooling must include educating children on values and character, as well as how to interact well with others, set goals for themselves and work towards achieving those goals. Positive education, a movement that is gaining momentum across the world, works to create a school culture that supports caring, trusting relationships. It is an approach that focuses on specific skills that assist students to build positive emotions, enhance personal resilience, promote mindfulness and encourage a healthy lifestyle. This approach has worked well with schools that are trying to implement the new syllabuses for character and citizenship education, launched in the last three years. An important segment of the new curriculum, at the primary level is family time, and how parents should play an important role in inculcating the right values in their children. At the secondary and high school levels, \"values in action\" programmes lie at the core of educating young Singaporeans to be empathetic, socially responsible and active citizens in their community. For example, students work on projects that serve the elderly, reach out to migrant workers and read to latch-key children in day-care centres. There have also been calls for more flexibility over admissions to local top schools and universities to encompass selection based on character traits such as drive, resilience and passion. To enhance equity, the education ministry has also attempted to spread resources more evenly across schools by rotating experienced principals to schools that need more attention and paying more attention to academically weaker students by strengthening vocational and skills training. All round, government leaders have expounded a wider definition of success beyond academic grades. The media and elite schools have been discouraged from showcasing top students and their academic achievements. There has also been a nationwide initiative called SkillsFuture which puts, in the first instance 500 Singapore dollars (£290) in the hands of every Singaporean from age 25 onwards, for them to pursue lifelong learning, build personal mastery and pursue their passion. An online databank with at least 10, 000 courses that Singaporeans can sign up for, to broaden or deepen their skills or take on new hobbies, is easily accessible. School-based education and career guidance counsellors are also provided at the primary to tertiary levels, to nurture students\' self-awareness, self-directedness and life skills. Drawn from people with industry experience, the counsellors help students to explore education and career options. They should be able to help students with information about the skills needed for the digital economy, so that students can go beyond what they learn for exams. This is a softer approach - emphasising values and character and trying to improve the link between school and work. It\'s the search for the next formula for education in Singapore.',business

Nissan announced in October last year that it planned to build two new models at its Sunderland plant. arising from Britain\'s decision to leave the EU. The SNP submitted a Freedom of Information (FOI) request last October, asking to see the Nissan letter. But despite being required to respond by 28 November, the Department for Business has yet to provide a response.

'Google\'s troll-hunting AI fooled by typos A prototype AI that spots online trolling can be tricked with a few typos, researchers have shown. The system, from Google spin-off company Jigsaw, fails to detect words like \"idiot\" and \"stupid\" as toxic language when misspelled as \"idiiot\" or \"st. upid\", for example. Jigsaw said its tool, , was still in development. One computer scientist said such systems would always have to adapt to the changing tactics of trolls. Jigsaw\'s tool is being developed to help automate the detection of abuse and harassment online. \"Perspective scores comments based on the perceived impact a comment might have on a conversation,\" the Jigsaw website says. But researchers from the University of Washington, has not yet been peer-reviewed, found the system was far from infallible. Toxicity score While the AI graded certain phrases as toxic, almost identical ones could sneak by with just a few creative typos: \"They are liberal idiots who are uneducated\" (90\% toxicity score) \"They are liberal i. diots who are un. educated\" (15\% toxicity score) There were false positive examples as well - in which innocuous phrases (such as \"It\'s not stupid and wrong\") were erroneously graded as toxic.

'London loses out in business rates revamp The revaluation of business rates next month will see London paying an extra £800m a year to support services in other parts of England, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. Under the changes, London councils will see their incomes rise as business rates there jump, while northern councils will lose out as rates fall. As a result, London councils will have to pay more to \"top up\" other councils. The IFS said this reflected a \"greater reliance\" on the capital. Neil Amin-Smith, one of the report\'s authors, said: \"Revaluation will mean rates bills will go up, and revenues become more concentrated in London. This is part of a more general trend of greater reliance on the capital for revenues.\" Revenue neutral Business rates are in effect the commercial version of council tax, and are paid on the rental value of the space that businesses occupy. The amount depends on the size of the property and what it\'s used for. The next business rates revaluation comes into effect on 1 April - the first for seven years. Although many businesses are expecting small falls in business rates in April, about a third are expecting very sharp rises, with a fifth, mainly in the South East, expecting a rise of more than 40\% immediately. The government says three quarters of businesses\' rates will either go down or stay the same. The changes are designed to be \"revenue neutral\" across England as a whole. However, rates in London are due to go up by about 11\% above inflation over the next five years, while rates in northern England will fall by 10\%. Business rates revenues are redistributed among councils to compensate those that lose out. London councils are not the only ones that will \"top up\" local authorities in other regions. However, the changes mean that those in the capital will contribute an extra £400m a year to councils with less income from business rates. In addition, all councils pay half their revenue from business rates to central government. As a result of the changes, London councils will be paying an extra £400m into this central pot. Redistribution The changes to business rates is part of a wider trend for London to shoulder a bigger proportion of the UK\'s tax take. In the 2004-5 tax year London\'s taxes - including income tax, corporation tax and stamp duty - accounted for 25\% of Britain\'s overall tax revenue. By 2014-15 that had increased to 30\%. However, one of the report\'s authors said it depended on your point of view as to whether this was a good or a bad thing. \"As London\'s economy pulls further ahead, more of its revenues need to be redistributed to stop the rest of the country falling behind,\" said David Phillips, IFS associate director. In the longer term, though, London stands to gain from increase in business rates, because the rules mean it will be allowed to retain the higher rates it gets from any new developments in the capital.

'Downton Abbey movie \'could be filmed this year\' A big screen version of Downton Abbey could be filmed this year, one of its cast members has said. Jeremy Swift, who played butler Septimus Spratt, told ITV\'s Lorraine that the cast had been sent a script - but that it had since \"disappeared\". He went on: \"It\'s supposed to be happening - filming - this year, but it hasn\'t been locked down yet.\"The period TV drama, which was a hit around the world, ended at Christmas 2015 after six series. There has been much speculation about a movie version. Swift said: \"There is a film script which we\'ve all been sent but it disappeared in a Mission Impossible-stylee from our emails. With a little puff.\"He said \"logistics\" were causing a problem with filming and that Downton\'s success had meant that some cast members had \"flown off into the world\" to work on other projects.\"It\'s just getting everybody in that same space and time,\" he added. \"I think there is a huge appetite for it.\" Carnival Films, which produces the drama, has already confirmed that a script for a potential movie is in development. It told the BBC on Monday: \"There are still no firm plans about when a film might go into production. When the future plans are certain we will of course make an announcement at the relevant time.\"In April 2016, Downton creator Julian Fellowes said he was already thinking about a plot for a film adaptation to avoid being \"caught on the hop\" if it was given the go-ahead. Downton Abbey received a in 2015. It is the most nominated non-US show in the history of the Emmy Awards and was shown in more than 250 territories worldwide.',entertainment
'Homelessness Reduction Bill to become law A new law which will require earlier intervention by councils to prevent homelessness has passed its final parliamentary hurdle. The Homelessness Reduction Bill also requires councils to provide advice and help to all affected, not just those protected under existing laws. The private member\'s bill, introduced by Conservative MP Bob Blackman, received government backing. The government will be providing £61m to councils to meet the costs incurred. Mr Blackman, who claimed on Twitter it was the most expensive private member\'s bill ever passed, said: \"I am immensely proud of everything that has been accomplished in this bill. \"It is profoundly wrong that homeless people who approach their council for help can be turned away to sleep on the street at the moment and that legislation in this area hasn\'t changed for the last four decades.\"Government backing The Homelessness Reduction Bill will oblige councils to start assessing someone at risk of being made homeless 56 days before losing their home. Currently, the threat of homelessness is defined as starting 28 days before the person loses their home. The government took the decision to back the private member\'s bill last year, with Communities Secretary Sajid Javid saying ministers were \"determined to do all we can to help those who lose their homes and provide them with the support they need to get their lives back on track\". The bill comes as the number of people sleeping on the streets increased by 16\% last year, up from 3, 569 in 2015 to 4, 134 in 2016. \'Bill will struggle\' However, local government representatives feel that without additional funding and support for councils, the additional legal protections introduced by the bill will mean little in practice. Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: \"It is clear that legislative change alone will not resolve homelessness. It is crucial that the government recognise and address the wider factors that are increasing homelessness, such as the lack of affordable housing and welfare reforms. Without this, the bill will struggle to achieve its aim of reducing homelessness.\"Councils need powers and funding to address the widening gap between incomes and rents, resume their historic role as a major builder of new affordable homes and join up all local services - such as health, justice and skills. This is the only way to deliver our collective ambition to end homelessness.\"The bill passed in the Lords unopposed. ',politics
'Snapchat fans: \'Don\'t change app\' As the owner of the Snapchat messaging app targets a valuation of about $24bn (£20bn), one question hangs in the air: will it stay cool? Users of the popular service are wondering how Snapchat might change as efforts to make it profitable evolve. Most of Snapchat\'s users are aged between 13 and 24, and many advertisers choose to target people in their teens and 20s via the app. Snapchatters out shopping in London spoke to the BBC about why the service seems to resonate so strongly with young people - and whether they\'ll stick with it should advertising become more prevalent. Dominic, 21, said he uses the app every day. \"You don\'t have to go through a news feed,\" he points out - a key benefit, it seems. Snapchat isn\'t as laden with information as Facebook, for example.\"And it\'s so short - I\'ve not got patience to read big statuses. It\'s visual.\" Plus, importantly, you can see which of your friends have viewed your latest post. Many young people that use Snapchat are well aware that older generations don\'t quite get it. \"My mum couldn\'t work it,\" said Grace, also 21. Dominic agreed this was important - it means he feels comfortable to just \"post whatever\". \"The older people as well, they wouldn\'t post much, because they\'re just making dinner and doing the housework,\" he says. \"Young people are doing more fun things like going out.\"Snapped up This has always been Snapchat\'s unique selling proposition. It\'s seen as cool. But growing an audience and trying to make a profit necessitates tweaking what was once an app where people merely sent pictures back and forth to one another. One of the original attractions was that those pictures would expire shortly after they were viewed - but since summer last year, users have been able to save them via a feature called Snapchat Memories.\"I kind of preferred it when it was just simple, send pictures that disappeared,\" said Charlie, also in his early 20s. There are already advertisements on Snapchat, but it is possible the app will feature more as Snap searches for that elusive profit.\"If there were adverts all the time, I wouldn\'t go on it,\" added Charlie, however. He and his friend Claire agreed on another point: if they had to pay to use it, that would definitely discourage them. Olivia is another Snapchat fan who\'s been using the app for a few years. But when Snapchat in 2015, the move \"put her off\", she said. Seeking a niche For her, Snapchat is already less enticing than it used to be.\"They need a new niche that will attract people back,\" she said. It\'s worth remembering a young audience, while often highly engaged with social media, can also be somewhat fickle. Beatrice, 29, was blogging about her experiences as a student in London, and using Snapchat, when she noticed a sudden shift. \"Everyone started using [a Snapchat-like way of sending annotated photos to contacts],\" she said.\"Everybody moved to Instagram Stories and I lost a lot of followers - so I decided to use that [instead].\"As other services have offered Snapchat-like interactions, Snapchat has also evolved, incorporating new features such as video chat. Niila, who is 19 and from Finland, said: \"It\'s not so good when applications start to be the same as one another.\"It is important, then, that Snapchat continues to be seen as somehow different. Though, interestingly, perhaps the idea the app remains largely unknown to older generations is not such a crucial factor for all. Niila\'s mother used it, he said. \"It\'s not only for young people,\" said Kia, 19, also from Finland. Perhaps Melissa, 23, who has been using Snapchat for four or five years, hit the nail on the head. She likes how the app has obviously been designed to appeal to young people and suggested there might not be any need to over-think its appeal.\"It\'s just a fun way to send pictures to your friends,\" she said.',tech
'Scotland 1-0 Slovenia - Billy Dodds rates the players Scotland remain in with a chance of reaching the 2018 World Cup in Russia after their at Hampden on Sunday night. Substitute Chris Martin grabbed the crucial winner with just two minutes to play, and it was the least the Scots deserved. On a night when several men in dark blue stood out, former Scotland striker Billy Dodds gives his marks out of 10 for Gordon Strachan\'s side. Scotland Craig Gordon (goalkeeper) 7 Very little to do but one crucial save at his near post in the first half. A typical Craig Gordon performance. Kieran Tierney (right-back) 7 Didn\'t look out of position at right-back and settled into the role immediately. Didn\'t get forward as much as he does for Celtic but another impressive performance from the teenager. Russell Martin (centre-back) 7 The Norwich defender was not asked too many questions but showed great concentration levels throughout. Unlucky not to score with a shot from a corner in the first minute. Charlie Mulgrew (centre-back) 7 Exactly the same as his centre back colleague. Never looked ruffled and handled what little came his way with ease. Andy Robertson (left-back) 9 A man-of-the-match performance. Outstanding for the full 90 minutes, showing immense energy levels and qualities in attack and defence throughout the game. Scott Brown (centre midfield) 7 A typical Scott Brown performance. the captain was a real powerhouse in the Scotland midfield, proving once again that he can still compete at international level. He was involved in a few feisty tussles, with his opponents coming off second best. James Morrison (centre midfield) 6 Flitted in and out of the game but when on the ball his distribution was effective. Stuart Armstrong (centre midfield) 8 One of the all-time best debuts in a Scotland jersey. Carried on his club form for Celtic into the international arena. A certain starter against England. James Forrest (wing) 6 Grew into the game after a quiet start. Had some decent driving runs but was subjected some heavy tackles from the Slovenia defence. Robert Snodgrass (wing) 6 Not his best performance in a Scotland jersey. Great cross in for Griffiths in the first half but didn\'t create enough. Leigh Griffiths (striker) 6 Hit the crossbar with a left-foot volley when he should have found the back of the net. Also hit the post with a crisp right foot shot. Worked hard but had to be replaced early in the second half after taking a knock in the back. Substitutes Steven Naismith (replaced Griffiths after 49 minutes) 5 Put himself about a bit without causing Slovenia too many problems. Ikechi Anya (replaced Snodgrass after 75 minutes) 6 Should have scored within a minute of coming on for Snodgrass but certainly helped put the visitors on the back foot in the closing minutes. Chris Martin (replaced Morrison after 82 minutes) 7 Jeered on but cheered off after scoring the goal that keeps Scotland\'s hopes of reaching Russia next year alive. He showed a real strong mentality to turn the Tartan Army his way.',sport
'Is China retaliating against Lotte missile deal? China is a crucial market for many South Korean companies, and the food and retail giant Lotte is no exception. The fifth biggest firm in South Korea gets an estimated 30\% of its sales from China, and employs about 20, 000 people there. But in the past week, several of its businesses have faced a backlash from hackers, customers and Chinese partners. On Monday, Lotte said that more than 10 of its department stores across the country had been closed down suddenly. So what\'s going on? Background: Missiles and a golf course At the end of February, Lotte finally agreed to provide land it owned in South Korea - which includes part of a golf course - so the US could build its controversial Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system. With the ability to shoot down ballistic missiles, the US says it is an important line of defence against North Korea\'s missile development programme. But over the past few months, Beijing has been lobbying heavily against it - saying the system\'s powerful radars are capable of monitoring Chinese territory. It disputes the argument that it will bring more stability to the region, saying it should not be allowed to go ahead. What has happened? As well as its shops and food businesses, Lotte also has hotels and cinemas in China. But since signing the deal last week Lotte, has reported various operations in China have been disrupted. On Monday, photos and videos were circulating of protests outside Lotte stores. \"South Korea\'s Lotte has declared war on China. Lotte supports THAAD. Get the hell out of China\" said one banner. While confirming the department store closures, Lotte has given no explanation. Other incidents include: Lotte Duty Free, the world\'s biggest duty free company which makes 70\% of its sales to Chinese customers, said its website had been taken offline by a cyber attack. It is now up and running again. Cosmetics retailer Jumei Youpin said it had \"completely scrubbed the name of Lotte from our website\". It added: \"We\'d rather die than carry its goods in future\". Chinese e-commerce site JD. com - which serves as a platform for retailers to sell online - temporarily closed the Lotte shopping site. Technical issues were blamed. Snack maker Weilong said it was pulling its products from all Lotte stores, saying it would \"no longer cooperate\" with the South Korean firm. Prior to the missile deal being signed, Lotte had reported its businesses being put under extra scrutiny from tax authorities. And in February, a multi-billion dollar property project in China\'s north-east was halted after a fire inspection. Is Lotte being paranoid? Beijing certainly has not admitted any economic retaliation and Lotte has been restructuring loss-making China businesses. But China\'s state-run news agency Xinhua has described Lotte\'s decision to provide the land as \"opening a Pandora\'s box in North East Asia.\"Separately, it has written that \"the decision could turn into a nightmare for Lotte, which depends heavily on Chinese tourists to South Korea for revenue from duty free stores\". Meanwhile Lotte itself has not said directly that any of the incidents were linked to the missile project controversy. But South Korea\'s trade minister Joo Hyung-hwan, who has recently had an invitation to an annual forum withdrawn, has expressed \"deep concerns over a series of actions in China\".\"We will act accordingly to international law against any actions that violate policies of the World Trade Organization or the free trade agreement between South Korea and China,\" he said. Is it only Lotte that\'s affected? There are reports of a broader backlash against South Korean products and industries from China. China\'s national tourism administration has told travel agencies to stop selling group packages in South Korea, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap. And Yonhap also reports that some Chinese streaming platforms have removed Korean material from their sites - a blow to viewers of the dramas which are increasingly popular.',business
'Caroline Wyatt: MS \'brain fog\' lifted after stem cell treatment BBC journalist Caroline Wyatt has spoken of how the \"brain fog began to lift\" after she had pioneering treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The former BBC defence correspondent was deemed unsuitable for an NHS trial and paid $60, 000 (£48, 000) for a stem cell transplant in Mexico in January. Wyatt, 49, told BBC Radio 4\'s PM programme that she was \"feeling better than I have done in a long time\". She also spoke of how it had taken 25 years for doctors to diagnose her MS.\'Near miraculous\' About 100, 000 people in the UK are affected by MS, an incurable lifelong condition that can cause numbness, tingling in the fingers and people may struggle to walk or think clearly. It can also affect vision, cause stiffness and spasms, tremors and cognitive difficulties. Wyatt decided to go to a private hospital in Puebla, Mexico, after talking to former patients, who had undergone a course of chemotherapy and transplanting stem cells.\"The chemo was to burn out the old faulty immune system so that you can have your stem cells harvested - and then brought back into the system,\" she said.\"This helps you to grow a new immune system which I hope will not have the faults of the old one.\" She said some of the patients who had had the had spoken of \"near miraculous results\". \"People who had been in wheelchairs, or people who had been struggling to walk or to think or to speak clearly had come back after the treatment and, if you were a lay person, you\'d say they looked cured, if you were a medic, you\'d probably say they were in remission.\"\"That inspired me to go.\"\"For me the results have been more gradual and gentle,\" the former BBC religious affairs correspondent and PM presenter said.\"Three weeks since coming back I am feeling better than I have done for a long time,\" she added. \"The main thing that happened was that the brain fog began to lift.\"Multiple sclerosis In MS the protective layer surrounding nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord - known as myelin - becomes damaged. The immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin, causing scarring or sclerosis. The damaged myelin disrupts the nerve signals - rather like the short circuit caused by a frayed electrical cable. If the process of inflammation and scarring is not treated then eventually the condition can cause permanent neurodegeneration. Wyatt, who first noticed some of the symptoms in 1990, said: \"It is a very difficult disease to get diagnosed. \"Because I was a journalist when I went to doctors they said, \'Ah, you\'ve got repetitive strain injury\'.\"\'Aggressive treatment\' She changed jobs but, following a relapse in 2001, she was given a brain scan and told she might have MS - a diagnosis that was confirmed following more invasive tests such as a spinal tap in 2015. Wyatt initially tried various drug treatments but as her condition began to deteriorate she began to investigate the stem cell treatment.\"I got in touch with Sheffield who were the British arm of a trial... and they very kindly agreed to see me,\" she said.\"They did various tests but decided in the end that medically speaking I was not one of the best candidates so they couldn\'t do it here.\"Wyatt said that although UK bodies such as the NHS and watchdog NICE describe the treatment as experimental, about 80\% of people who had the treatment responded to some degree and more than 50\% saw the progression of their MS halted. The charity the MS Society says the treatment could have long-term benefits for some people with MS but that larger studies are needed to better understand the impact of this aggressive treatment compared with existing therapies.',entertainment

'Football has become middle class, claims Andy McLaren Scotland widely bemoans a lack of footballing talent emerging to match the stars of yesteryear. As the national side sees out what appears to be another failed attempt to reach a major championship, former international Andy McLaren feels the game has abandoned a once rich source of talent. He\'s providing football sessions in some of the most deprived areas of Glasgow, to kids who can\'t afford to pay to play. \"Football, in my opinion, has become middle class,\" McLaren told BBC Radio Scotland\'s Sportsound programme in an interview to be broadcast on Monday evening.\"It\'s an absolute disgrace that kids are being priced out of football in this country.\"It\'s meant to be our national sport. It\'s meant to be all-inclusive. At the moment it\'s not. \"I would have been priced out of football just now. \"I grew up in Castlemilk, a housing estate on the south side of Glasgow. Up until I was 15, I thought that was the way everybody grew up.\"Crime, heroin, drink - football was my escape route from all of that. Football was important, took me away from an area that was hard growing up in. It gave me something to focus on.\"McLaren is part of a charitable organisation trying to give young people opportunity, particularly through football but in other ways too, in order to tackle the stark disadvantage that simply being born into a certain postcode can bring.\'Missing out on the next Dalglish\' He feels the game he loves, which did so much for him, is now leaving those kids behind.\"I\'ve been working in these areas for seven, eight years and I think I\'ve seen an SFA coach once,\" he said.\"Remember these are areas guys like Kenny Dalglish, Frank McAvennie, Bertie Auld (came from); really we could be missing out on the next Kenny Dalglish because he\'s not got a fiver a week.\"For me that\'s wrong; it\'s meant to be our national sport.\"That\'s the nub of the problem as far as he sees it. Families in these areas simply can\'t afford to pay for their children to participate in football.\"I keep hearing that kids don\'t want to play football,\" he explained. \"Come up and see us on a Friday night or come to one of our camps and see 200-250 boys running about and tell me kids don\'t want to play football.\"People keep telling me that cost isn\'t an issue - 100\% cost is an issue. \"We\'re not getting the same kids from the same areas. Growing up in Castlemilk I genuinely can\'t remember paying for football. Maybe it was 10 pence or you sold a football card now and again.\"People are struggling out there. We started eight years ago and very quickly we\'d see young people with holes in their shoes and things like that. \"Some would turn up for camps with no packed lunch. Very quickly we learned we had to feed them because the coaches were having to give them their lunches.\"People will go to me, \'it\'s the parents\' fault\' but people out there are struggling with mental health issues or addiction issues. \"I think we\'re easy in this country to blame people. If you see someone struggling it\'s our job to help the less fortunate. \"As a society, I think we can do a lot more. \"Areas we work in are areas of high deprivation, the top 5\% of every poverty chart you can get. \"If we charged &pound; 1 we wouldn\'t have the same success because the money is not there.\"Football as salvation As a former professional with Dundee United, Kilmarnock, Reading and Morton, McLaren is keen not only to give children of a similar background to his a chance, he also wants them to learn from his mistakes. Those mistakes took the form of a reliance on alcohol and drugs through much of his playing career. He did that as he couldn\'t cope with a harrowing experience as a child. McLaren was abused at a young age by someone in his local community. Ultimately, it brought him to the point of almost taking his own life. Shame, fear, embarrassment, blaming himself and the dressing room environment had all prevented him from unburdening himself for decades. Football was his salvation rather than part of the problem.\"Some nights I\'d be struggling,\" he admitted. \"I didn\'t know how to deal with what I was dealing with.\"I wasn\'t taking them (drugs and alcohol) socially. I was taking them for effect.\"It wasn\'t as if anyone forced me to do anything. I was a willing participant. I enjoyed it.\" McLaren believes a failed drug test while playing at Reading saved his life, as did the support of the English FA who paid for him to rehabilitate at the Priory clinic. He was talented, won a Scottish Cup with Dundee United, and remarkably battled back after falling from grace to win a Scotland cap. He may have had more. Thankfully, for all the negatives of his own experience, there\'s a positive outcome which is benefiting children growing up in areas like he did.',sport
'Insurance premiums \'set to soar\' after compensation changes Average car insurance premiums could increase by up to £75 a year as a result of a government ruling, industry experts have said. A new formula for calculating compensation payments for those who suffer long-term injuries has been announced by the Ministry of Justice. But the Association of British Insurers (ABI) called the decision \"crazy\". The Ministry of Justice said it had no choice under the current law, and said it would consult on possible changes. with some saying that profits would be hit by millions of pounds. The change is due to take effect from 20 March. How compensation works Accident victims are paid compensation in a single lump sum, which in serious cases is supposed to support them for the rest of their lives. But someone who receives that lump sum can actually increase that amount by investing it, and getting a cash return. So to be fair to insurance companies, the payout is reduced accordingly. For the past 16 years the discount rate, as it is called, has been set at a typical rate of 2. 5\% - making the payout that much smaller. Now the Ministry of Justice to reduce the discount rate from 2. 5\% to minus 0. 75\%. That will result in more money for the victim, but a higher cost for the insurer. The change was ordered because the formula assumes the victim were to invest his or her money in government bonds. By the time inflation is taken into account, real returns on such bonds have become negative.\'£1, 000 increase\' Reducing the discount rate to minus 0. 75\% was a \"crazy decision\", said Huw Evans, director-general of the Association of British Insurers (ABI).\"Claims costs will soar, making it inevitable that there will be an increase in motor and liability premiums for millions of drivers and businesses across the UK,\" he said.\"We estimate that up to 36 million individual and business motor insurance policies could be affected in order to over-compensate a few thousand claimants a year.\" Experts said higher insurance premiums could cost drivers under the age of 22 up to £1, 000 a year.\"We anticipate an increase of £50-£75 on an average comprehensive motor insurance policy, with higher increases for younger and older drivers - potentially up to £1, 000 for younger drivers, and a rise of up to £300 for older drivers,\" said Mohammad Khan, UK general insurance leader at accountancy firm PwC. Older drivers includes anyone over the age of 65. However, accident victims are set to benefit as they will receive higher pay-outs. Lawyers who had campaigned in favour of the changes welcomed the news.\"People already coping with the most severe injuries have been deprived of the help and care they need for years,\" said the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers. Consultation A number of insurance companies said their finances would be hit as a result of the changes. Direct Line said it expected its pre-tax profits to be reduced by as much as £230m.

'Derek Walcott: St Lucia\'s Nobel laureate poet dies Nobel laureate poet Derek Walcott has died aged 87 at his home on the Caribbean island of St Lucia after a long illness, local media reports say. He was regarded by critics as one of the greatest Caribbean poets. The writer\'s collections include In A Green Night: Poems 1948 - 1960 and his epic work, Omeros, which draws on Homer\'s Iliad and Odyssey. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1992 and the TS Eliot Prize for Poetry in 2011. His winning collection for the TS Eliot Prize, White Egrets, was called \"a moving, risk-taking and technically flawless book by a great poet\" by the judges. The Nobel Committee, announcing his prize, said: \"His poetry acquires at one and the same time singular lustre and great force... Walcott\'s style is melodious and sensitive.\" A unique poetic voice: analysis by Will Gompertz, BBC arts editor Derek Walcott found that he was often defined as a black writer. That is not how he saw himself. He was, he said, first and foremost, a Caribbean writer. Dante, Shakespeare, Chaucer and Yeats were all addressed and reassessed through his Caribbean-focussed literary lens. As was Homer - in 1990 - when he wrote his epic poem Omeros - in which Achilles finds himself relocated to the West Indies. His great skill, and gift to literature, was the way in which he used his unique poetic voice to explore and explain the world from a largely unseen perspective. He was never parochial or nationalistic, quite the opposite in fact. Derek Walcott was a master at using the specific to identify common ground and universal themes, illuminating both the individual and the collective. The poet won many other prizes, including a MacArthur Foundation award - the so-called \"\". Walcott said at the time: \"It\'s nice to get it, because it gives you four or five years of a great deal of security - the tough thing is when it\'s finished!\"It has a very bad connotation, this idea of a \'genius\' - I\'m not denying the fact that I\'m prodigious, I\'m not denying the fact that I wrote well... to me it\'s a gift. I feel blessed that I was gifted.\"Appearing on BBC Radio 4\'s Desert Island Discs in 1992, he said he had written as far back as he could remember and recalled his mother, a schoolteacher, reciting Shakespeare at home. His father, who died while he was still an infant, had also written poetry, he said.\"I heard that kind of sound at home from when I was very young,\" he said. \"I always knew that was what I wanted to do - to write, particularly poetry.\"Born in 1930, he studied at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, before moving to Trinidad in 1953, where he worked as a theatre and art critic. He published his first collection, 25 Poems, at the age of 18. He was also an accomplished painter and playwright. The Cultural Development Foundation of St Lucia paid tribute to Walcott, saying in a statement: \"The world has lost one of its noted literary icons. \"Our sympathies extend to St Lucia as a nation, who without doubt are proud and honoured to call him a true son of St Lucia.\"He was very vocal about the island\'s culture and heritage, and its preservation, and his love for St Lucia and the Caribbean was evident in his numerous mentions of \'home\' in his work.\"Speaking about the shock of returning home to St Lucia, Walcott said: \"You had to balance off the beauty of the place with some of the poverty around you.\"The Poetry Society and encouraged others to read in memoriam. Walcott was also embroiled in controversy over his candidacy for the post of Oxford Professor of Poetry in 2009. He pulled out of the race after academics at the university received dozens of anonymous letters linking him to an allegation of sexual harassment in 1982. The eventual winner - the first woman to hold the prestigious position - when it emerged she had briefed journalists on the allegations.',entertainment
'Britons should keep EU rights post-Brexit - Guy Verhofstadt British citizens should be allowed to keep the benefits of EU membership, according to the chief Brexit negotiator at the European Parliament. Guy Verhofstadt said allowing individuals to keep rights, such as freedom to travel and vote in European elections should be a priority. He also warned the European Parliament had veto powers over any deal struck. Meanwhile EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker has said he hopes the British will one day be persuaded to re-join the EU. Prime Minister Theresa May wants to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of March, which would pave the way for Brexit negotiations, in which the rights of EU nationals living in the UK and Brits living on the continent will be a key issue. Mr Verhofstadt, who leads the liberal group of MEPs in the European Parliament, told the BBC that the matter had to be prioritised and \"cannot be part of the political games\" that have taken place over the last few months. Tragedy, disaster, catastrophe He told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme he had received more than 1, 000 letters from UK citizens who did not want to lose their relationship with \"European civilisation\". Mostly these were driven by emotion and a feeling that they did not want to lose their European identity post-Brexit, he said, adding that he did not understand why the negative fall-out from the decision had not been discussed during the referendum, which had instead focused on the economics of Britain leaving the EU. Many of the letters began with the appeal that \"\'I\'m a UK citizen - I don\'t want to lose my relationship with Europe and European civilisation,\'\" he said. \"So emotion is now coming up and all those voters will want to remain in the European Union and have the feeling that they are lost, that nobody is defending them anymore, that they are losing a part of that identity - and it\'s for that reason that I\'m trying to convince the European Union, not only the European Parliament, to take on board that feeling of UK citizens.\"I think we need to examine what type of special arrangement we can make for those individual citizens who want to continue their relationship with the EU, and the opposite - it\'s for both sides.\"Peace process Mr Verhofstadt said the situation \"is a crisis for the EU\". \"The fact that a large country like Britain is leaving the EU...? It\'s shown a crisis in the European Union - it\'s a disaster. That Britain goes out of the EU is a tragedy, a disaster, a catastrophe - you name it.\"He said the responsibility now is to look for \"a new partnership\" between the EU and the UK, but he stressed: \"Unfortunately, because of the decision taken by the UK government, it can\'t be the single market - because they don\'t accept the full freedom.\"It cannot be the customs union, because they want to make their own trade deals. It cannot be the European Court of Justice - it cannot be the European economic area.\"Pressed on whether a good deal could still be reached that can work for both sides, he said: \"That\'s exactly what we\'re going to try to do.\"But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters he hoped that the British could one day be persuaded to re-join the EU.\"I don\'t like Brexit because I would like to be in the same boat as the British,\" he said. \"The day will come when the British will re-enter the boat, I hope. \"But Brexit is not the end of Europe. By contrary, Brexit is encouraging the others to continue, unfortunately without the British.... Brexit, it\'s not the end - I regret it but we will continue.\"\'Voted down\' During the BBC interview, Mr Verhofstadt insisted that there could be \"no hard border\" between the Republic of Ireland, that will remain in the EU, and Northern Ireland, which is leaving. \"What can\'t happen is that we destroy all the efforts that have been undertaken over the last 20 to 30 years to have peace there, so no hard border,\" he said. He also warned the European Parliament will have the power of veto any deal brokered between the UK and the European Commission on Brexit.\"We vote no - that is possible,\" he told Today. \"It has happened in a number of other cases that a big international multilateral agreement was voted down by the European Parliament after it was concluded.\"The fact that in the treaty it is stated we have to say yes or no doesn\'t mean that automatically we vote yes.\"Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated that the UK Parliament will vote on the terms of exit before the European Parliament but that the UK will leave the EU anyway, irrespective of whether MPs approve or reject them. Asked whether the UK would welcome the opportunity for British nationals to retain some of the benefits of EU citizenship after Brexit, No 10 said it was \"not something that we have ever proposed or said that we are looking at\". \"We will go into negotiations and discuss the ideas put forward by the EU and its various institutions,\" said a Downing Street spokesman.

'Russian man pleads guilty over $500m malware scam A Russian man faces up to 10 years in jail for spreading a computer virus that cost victims more than $500m (£401m). Mark Vartanyan, 29, developed and distributed the Citadel Trojan, which lets criminals steal bank account details and hold files to ransom. US prosecutors said it had infected about 11 million computers worldwide. He to one count of computer fraud, in a court in Atlanta, after being extradited from Norway. Launched in 2011, Citadel was marketed on invitation-only, Russian-language internet forums used by cybercriminals. Its users had targeted the computer networks of major financial and government institutions around the world, prosecutors said. \'Illicit functionality\' Vartanyan admitted to the \"development, improvement, maintenance and distribution\" of Citadel between 2012 and 2014 while living in Ukraine and Norway. Operating under the alias Kolypto, he uploaded that consisted of Citadel malware, components, updates and patches, as well as customer information. Earlier in March, David LeValley, special agent at the FBI Atlanta Office, said Vartanyan\'s arrest removed \"a significant player\" from the resources available to cybercriminals.\"We must continue to impose real costs on criminals who believe they are protected by geographic boundaries and can prey on the American people,\" he said. Vartanyan agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced prison term. He will be sentenced in June. In September 2015, a US court sentenced Russian citizen Dimitry Belorossov to four years and six months in prison after he admitted distributing and installing Citadel on to computers. The Department of Justice said its investigation into the creator of Citadel continued. ',tech
'Bitcoin value tops gold for first time A unit of the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin has exceeded the value of an ounce of gold for the first time. It closed at $1, 268 on Thursday while a troy ounce of gold stood at $1, 233. The current high is being attributed to surging demand in China, where authorities warn it is used to channel money out of the country. The past months\' surge is a major reversal for Bitcoin, which plummeted in value in 2014 after the largest exchange collapsed. The has been volatile since it was first launched in 2009, and many experts have questioned whether the crypto-currency will last. Earlier this year, Chinese authorities in an attempt to stop money flowing out of the country illegally. But the closer scrutiny from Beijing only briefly sent the currency lower. After it had soared to , it has since picked its steady rise in value. Bitcoin is attractive to some users because of its anonymity, as well as its lack of government control. The website Silk Road was closed in 2013 following raids by the FBI and other agencies amid allegations of drug dealing. Authorities seized millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin during the raids. How Bitcoin works . Yet like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called \"mining\" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day. There are currently about 15 million Bitcoins in existence. To receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent. Since there is no register of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings.',business

'MPs urge caution over Westminster repairs More scrutiny is needed of plans to spend billions of pounds renovating the Houses of Parliament, MPs say. The Commons Treasury Committee said no final decision should be taken on how to proceed until it had investigated the options.\"Large construction projects often go wrong,\" the committee said, and MPs would \"bear the brunt\" of criticism. Proposals have been put forward to move MPs and peers out of the building while urgent repairs take place. The , which has been costed at £4bn, was made in September by the Joint Committee on the Palace of Westminster. It would involve MPs moving into the Richmond House building on Whitehall currently occupied by the Department of Health. The Treasury committee said it would also examine an alternative option, opposed by the joint committee, of a \"partial decant\" where the Commons and Lords took turns to move out while repairs were taking place. It also said it would scrutinise the assessment by consultant Deloitte that this option would cost more and take longer. The Palace of Westminster, a World Heritage Site, has asbestos, leaks, old electrics and is said to be at high risk of \"catastrophic failure\". In a preliminary report, the committee said: \"Restoration and renewal of the Palace of Westminster is a major undertaking which will last many years and cost billions of pounds.\"The project will have a major impact on public perception of the work of the Commons and Lords, it said. The committee added: \"Given the enormous sums involved, it would be vital even in normal times that the case for the spending and its cost-effectiveness were thoroughly scrutinised and that the plans were rigorously challenged.\"It is even more important at a time of austerity, when restoration of the Palace will be competing for funds with many hard-pressed parts of the public sector.\"The committee concluded that until its report had been published, it would be \"imprudent\" for MPs to make a final decision. Last week Parliament\'s spending watchdog, the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said vacating the Palace of Westminster was the most economic and efficient option, and that further delays would add millions to the cost.',politics

'Business \'needs new migration system after Brexit\' A Scottish business leader has stepped up calls for a migration system that can fill skills gaps after Britain pulls out of the EU. Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) chief executive Liz Cameron highlighted the need for 11, 000 new roles each year in Scotland\'s digital and IT sector. She warned that the vacancies could not be filled entirely by British workers. Ms Cameron also called for a migration system that responded to Scotland\'s lower population growth rate.

She warned that could leave the economy growing more slowly and unable to sustain public service levels.

'The Casualty actor behind the Bob Marley musical You may know Kwame Kwei-Armah best as the paramedic Finlay Newton in the BBC\'s Casualty. But it\'s 13 years since he left the television series and since then he\'s carved a hugely successful career in the theatre. His new stage show is about the reggae legend Bob Marley. But he insists, it is \"absolutely not\" a jukebox musical, where the songs take precedence over the plot. Kwei-Armah, the writer and director of One Love, The Bob Marley Musical, says it is not \"sing-a-long-a-Bob\", but \"a play with music\". He admitted though that it was a \"delicate\" balancing act trying to keep in enough songs the audience will recognise. So hits including No Woman No Cry, Jamming, Three Little Birds and Redemption Song are among 30 tracks that feature in the show. But One Love is not your usual musical hero, womb to tomb story. Instead it focuses on just three years in Marley\'s life and career, which Kwei-Armah says are \"very significant\" in \"understanding the hero\'s journey of the man.\" Following an assassination attempt in 1976, the singer left his home in Jamaica and went to live in London in self imposed exile. While in England he recorded two of his biggest albums: Exodus and Kaya. Kwei-Armah said he wanted to get inside the mind of the man at that time and \"show a side of Bob that we don\'t often speak about.\"\"Bob being a political songwriter, I wanted to look at what were the years when he was tested. What were the years when he might have doubted himself? And I found these years to be that.\"Marley died of cancer in 1981 at the age of 36. But interest in him shows no sign of diminishing. It is estimated he has sold more than 50 million albums around the world. Time declared Exodus the best album of the 20th Century in 1999. The same year the BBC named One Love the song of the millennium. His Facebook page has more than 70 million fans - and Marley is in the top 15 most popular pages on the social media site. For many, Bob Marley is an idol - a civil rights activist who spoke up for the poor and oppressed. But he was not a saint. And Kwai-Armah says he does not gloss over Marley\'s womanising and drug use. He says he portrays him \"warts and all\". He adds: \"I don\'t need any hero to be an angel.\" The singer Mitchell Brunings is playing the title role. Born in Surinam, but raised in The Netherlands, he was a backing vocalist in a Marley tribute band, before entering the Dutch equivalent of the television talent show, The Voice. He sang Redemption Song and his performance went viral on YouTube. As a result, Kwai-Armah cast him in the lead role. It is his UK stage debut and he is feeling the pressure to do Marley justice.\"He has a very big following, a lot of his followers are fanatical about their devotion to him, which I understand because I am one of his followers myself. I don\'t want to do anything to damage his image.\" Marley\'s family has already given the show their blessing. His daughter Cedella has said: \"Birmingham is a natural place for its UK premiere. With its great mix of cultures, it\'s a city where my father performed to audiences that were captivated by his presence.\"We have no doubt that telling the story through music to a new generation in Birmingham will be part of his continuing legacy.\"',entertainment
'Could Brexit mean a referendum in Northern Ireland? On the Falls Road, heart of Republican Belfast. there\'s a new sense of purpose. Sinn Fein pulled the plug on Stormont, and are now, like the Scottish government, demanding a referendum on their future destiny. Brexit - in Northern Ireland - is seen as just the latest imposition by England. It has given a new momentum to their whole reason for existing: the belief the island of Ireland should be one country. Everywhere down the Falls there are here a mural of a young man with a rifle, there a huge sepia portrait celebrating the provisional Irish government set up in 1922. But there are new signs too, lots of them. Sinn Fein\'s latest posters say The referendum has changed politics here, as all over the UK, even on party night. The West is gyrating in a sea of joyous green on St Patrick\'s Day. The social club on the Falls Road in Belfast is packed full of people dancing and drinking. Some merely wear a token green T-shirt or badge, but several women are in elaborate emerald dress, men in bowlers or stetsons of the appropriate shade: any culture you like as long as its Irish. Inevitably one man is dressed as . Here even the plush is political. It\'s the greatest day of the year, says one woman: about Irishness, about all of Ireland. Does she feel British at all, I ask .\"Not at all, definitely Irish.\" British as well as Irish? I ask another reveller.\"No, no, pure Irish.\"And another tells me: \"Irish 100\%.\"What Mrs May calls the UK, the \"precious union of nations… the most successful the world has ever known\", is seen very differently here. They are in no doubt about Brexit, either - they are against it, unless you mean exiting from Britain, casting off what they see as the last shackles of the English Empire. \"We\'re not the UK, we\'re Ireland. We should have the right to vote. Theresa May is a fascist,\" one man tells me. They fear a return to a real border between the Republic and Northern Ireland.\"Borders! Nobody wants \'em. We\'re nationalists here. Loyalist don\'t want it. Business people don\'t want it.\" Hence the renewed demand for an all-Ireland referendum is being made by Sinn Féin as they look to exploit their success in the recent elections. You can believe they pulled out of Stormont in a row over an obscure environmental scheme if you want. But is deeper. Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister over the handling of that could cost £490m. But others forces were also in play. Sinn Fein activists were increasingly feeling they got little out of devolution, that their partners in government, the DUP, were treating them without respect. So they brought the whole thing crashing down. If they do not do a post-election deal in the coming weeks then there will have to be new elections or London will take over: that\'s called \"direct rule\". The prime minister appears to have ruled that out. The negotiations are a poker game but Sinn Fein has little to lose by blinking first. Their supporters want real movement on issues dear to their hearts, and a re-run of the election might see them increase their vote. The real thorny issues are old ones, about the role of the Irish language and what are known euphemistically as \"\'\': whether people should face criminal prosecution for what they did during the Troubles. The DUP\'s Nelson McCausland, who lost his assembly seat at the recent election, say this is not an opportunity for Sinn Fein, but a full stop.\"There has been over a number of years within Sinn Fein a concern they had not delivered on their united Ireland dream. What they have used over the years is the European Union and European harmonisation to promote the idea that we are being harmonised with the Republic. Brexit puts a stop to that.\"Unionists hardly need to argue against the call for a referendum. The British secretary of state only needs to agree to one if, in the words of the act \"it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting\" want a united Ireland. Pretty hazy. And not a single opinion poll or commentator suggests there is that majority. But the next day I return to the Falls and find a different picture from the hard line espoused by some of those at the West social club. Five people and their teacher sit around the table practising their Irish conversation. Among them, Linda Ervine who\'s been learning the language for six years.\"Because I am from the Protestant community I never had the opportunity to engage with the language and I fell in love with it.\"She says there are many links with her own heritage. \"We\'ve been very separate, British identity, Irish identity but in the last few years a Northern Irish identity is coming through more and more. For me I see myself as Irish and British, I don\'t see that as a contradiction.\"And there\'s the flood of people - including many Unionists and Protestants - applying for Irish passports in the wake of Brexit. The Belfast Newsletter newspaper\'s Sam McBride sees big changes under way. \"Unionism is facing a crisis at the moment, a seismic change.,\" he said. \"The fundamental question is that there is a significant number of Catholics who support the union with the United Kingdom - why are they not voting for unionist parties? I think the answer is the trappings of Orangism and Protestantism put those people off.\" There are straws in the wind across the border too. The cabinet in Dublin decided that eventually all Irish passport holders, including in the North, will be able to vote in presidential elections. The opposition party Fianna Fail is preparing is own white paper on plans for a united Ireland. But Republican commentator Chris Donnelly, like most observers on both sides of the divide, thinks there will not be a referendum, and it couldn\'t be won because many from that tradition feel more economically secure in the North.\"I think Sinn Fein know in their heart of hearts they are 20, 25 years away from when a border poll could actually have a credible chance of being won. It\'s an example of \"Hail Mary\" politics. It\'s a lottery move, its not going to happen but it is keeping the issue alive at the centre of political discussions.\"While we all get used to all new politics of identity, it has been the language of debate in Northern Ireland for centuries. Brexit has muddied the political waters. And a new political space may be up for grabs. ',politics
'School makes millions from Snapchat IPO A huge tech initial public offering raises billions. More money for super-rich investors and bankers, right? Well that\'s not the whole story. Not this time. If you\'re a parent, a letter home from school is common. But today, Simon Chiu, the president of Saint Francis High School in Mountain View, California, . In 2012, he began, the school invested $15, 000 in a cool new app that was being used incessantly by Andrew and Natalie Eggers, two siblings who attended the school. Their father Barry was a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, a local investment firm. , and learning that their friends were as obsessed as they were, he decided to get involved. It was, of course, Snapchat. He met with co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, who today are multi-millionnaires thanks to their company\'s incredible stock market debut, but back then were working out of a dorm room at Stanford. Mr Eggers was suitably impressed, and so Lightspeed led a $500, 000 investment round - Snapchat\'s first. \'Investment matured\' The firm invested $485, 000, but Mr Eggers also convinced Saint Francis High School to throw in $15, 000 from a school development fund set up in the 1990s. In what must go down as one of the understatements of the year, Mr Chiu\'s letter on Thursday continued: \"The school\'s investment in Snap has matured and given us a significant boost as we continue our work towards realising the bold vision and goals.\"One of those goals is to make education at Saint Francis - a private, Catholic school where tuition costs $17, 000 a year - more affordable to more people in the surrounding community. So how much did the school earn? It\'s hard to say exactly right now. It sold many of its shares on Thursday at the $17 opening price. That raised a cool $24m. It kept hold of a third - and at the close of play on Thursday, Snap\'s stock was up by 44\%. A great little earner - with perhaps a lot more still to come. In a blog post about the deal, Mr Eggers wrote: \"While I\'ve enjoyed Snap\'s journey with my partners as an early investor, I have the unexpected bonus of sharing the experience with my children. \"It\'s been amazing for us to watch how far Evan and Bobby and Snap have come since that kitchen table conversation between my daughter and me… and how much they\'ve already changed how we communicate today.\"',tech

Australia\'s economy had but the surprise 1. 1\% rise pulled the annual figure back to a 2. 4\% growth rate. The recovery was attributed largely to strong exports and consumer spending. Mining and agriculture enjoyed relatively strong growth in the three months to December. Iron ore and coal are Australia\'s biggest exports and reduced demand from China has cooled a mining boom and hurt the Australian economy. Australia has not had a recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - since June 1991. It is now just one quarter short of the Dutch record set between 1982 and 2008.

Capital Economics chief Australia economist Paul Dales said the economy was firmly \"back on track\".\"The decent rebound in real GDP in the fourth quarter doesn\'t just dash any lingering fears that Australia was in a recession, but it also boosts hopes that the surge in commodity prices will trigger a rapid recovery,\" he said.\"The outlook for the next year is reasonably bright,\" Shane Oliver of AMP Capital told the BBC. \"We are seeing a pickup in export volumes and we have seen a big rebound in key commodity prices.\"Mr Oliver added: \"Growth should probably get back to 2. 5\%, maybe 3\% over the course of this year.\" Estimates by the country\'s central bank point to economic growth rising to about 3\% for 2017 on the back of recovering commodity prices.',business

'Give Jeremy Corbyn 15 months, says Len McCluskey Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn should be \"given a chance\" and allowed 15 months to prove he can turn around opinion polls, says union boss Len McCluskey. The general secretary of Unite said Mr Corbyn was being \"slaughtered\" by the media for putting forward policies to build a \"different... better Britain\". He said Mr Corbyn himself would want to look at the party\'s direction if there was no change within 15 months. Mr Corbyn says Labour is ready for a general election if one is called. He has twice been elected party leader on a landslide of votes from party members but has faced opposition from many of his own MPs and a mass walkout from his front bench last year. \'Slaughtered by media\' The party has recently suffered defeat in the Copeland by-election - a seat it had held for more than 80 years - and poor poll ratings has led the Fabian Society think tank to warn the party is on course to win fewer than 200 seats for the first time since 1935 at the next general election. The latest suggest the Conservatives have a 19-point lead over Labour. Mr McCluskey, whose union is Labour\'s biggest financial backer, told BBC Radio 5 live\'s Pienaar\'s Politics that Mr Corbyn was a \"decent man\" who had upset the establishment by putting forward \"alternative\" policies for a \"fairer\" Britain and had been \"slaughtered unmercifully\" by the media since becoming leader. Pressed on whether Mr Corbyn could take Labour to victory in the next general election, he said: \"The reality is that I\'m hoping that he\'s given an opportunity to put the alternative that Labour are building to the British electorate and hopefully we\'ll see if he can break through and the opinion polls begin to change. \"I would suggest that the next 15 months or so will give us the answer to that. \"\"I think it will give us an answer. In the meantime Unite as we always do - because we\'re the biggest affiliate - will support the Labour Party.\"\'We are ready\' He added: \"Please give him a chance... I believe that there is a chance that [things can turn around].\"He said Mr Corbyn \"doesn\'t have an ego, he\'s not on a power trip\". The Labour leader \"himself would be involved in debates and discussions about where the party\'s going\" if, after 15 months, there was no change. But asked what he would do if Mr Corbyn had not made a significant impact within 15 months, he added: \"You have been at me for months and months to come up with timescales - I\'m not going to do that.\"The Labour leader appeared on ITV\'s Peston on Sunday and said the party would not block a government bid to repeal the Fixed-term Parliament Act - allowing a general election to take place before 2020. He said: \"We are developing our policies but clearly if an election is called we can bring all that forward and we are ready, yes... We would not block it, of course not, because if that\'s what is on offer, I don\'t know if that\'s in [Prime Minister Theresa May\'s] mind or not.\"Mr McCluskey has been involved in a row this week with his former flatmate - and Labour\'s deputy leader - Tom Watson, who has said Unite has plans to pump cash into left-wing campaign group Momentum, which Mr Watson says would threaten Labour\'s existence \"as an electoral force\". Mr McCluskey told Pienaar\'s Politics there had been a \"shameful campaign of lies, innuendo and smears\", warning: \"It strains the relationship between unions and the Labour Party.\" He is up for re-election at the end of next month and those close to Mr Watson are believed to see it as an opportunity to weaken both him and the current party leader. His main opponent is the West Midlands organiser Gerard Coyne, who is politically to his right. ',politics
'Uber uses \'secret program\' Greyball to hide from regulators Uber has been using a secret program to prevent undercover regulators from shutting down the taxi-hailing service in cities around the world. The software, called Greyball, sought to identify officials trying to catch its drivers and deny them service, the . Uber has frequently been at odds with governments - and with competitors. Greyball was used to secure early access to cities where its operations had not been authorised. In most cases, local officials wanted to make sure the company was subjected to the same conditions of service required by the legislation. The New York Times said existence of the Greyball program was confirmed by four current and former Uber employees, who were not named. Greyball identified regulators posing as ordinary passengers, by collecting data on the location used when ordering a taxi and determining whether this coincided with government offices. It also checked credit card information to establish whether the user is linked to an institution or law enforcement authority. Uber, the report adds, even visited phone shops to trace smartphones bought by city officials setting up multiple accounts in an effort to catch the company\'s drivers. Once individuals suspected of attempting to entrap drivers were identified, they would be served a \"fake\" version of the Uber app, with fictitious cabs on view, and where they were successful in ordering a real one, they would have their booking cancelled. Local officials contend this is illegal. Read more \"This program denies ride requests to fraudulent users who are violating our terms of service,\" Uber said in a statement.\"Whether that\'s people aiming to physically harm drivers, competitors looking to disrupt our operations, or opponents who collude with officials on secret \'stings\' meant to entrap drivers,\" it added. It comes in the same week that the chief executive of Uber, Travis Kalanick, was forced to apologise after a video emerged of him swearing at one of the company\'s drivers. Just two weeks earlier he apologised for \"abhorrent\" sexism at the company.',tech
'BA owner IAG launches new long-haul airline Level The owner of British Airways is launching a new long-haul budget airline based in Barcelona. IAG said the new airline, Level, would initially fly to Los Angeles, Oakland, Buenos Aires and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic from June. The airline will use Iberia crew and two new Airbus A330 planes. Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, said Level would become its fifth airline brand alongside Aer Lingus, BA, Iberia and Vueling.\"Barcelona is Vueling\'s home base and this will allow customers to connect from Vueling\'s extensive European network onto Level\'s long-haul flights,\" he said. The company will look to offer Level flights from other European cities. \"We\'re really excited about the opportunities for expansion,\" Mr Walsh added. Fares start from 99 euros/$149 each way. Low-cost challengers Travel writer and broadcaster Simon Calder said the new airline was good news for travellers as more competition would put pressure on fares. He said IAG\'s move echoed Lufthansa\'s decision to offer flights to destinations in the Caribbean and Asia on Eurowings, its low-cost offshoot. It was also an attempt to counter the challenge posed by low-cost newcomers such as Norwegian Airlines. As well as operating Boeing 787 services from London Gatwick airport to cities such as Orlando, Las Vegas and New York, Norwegian plans to offer direct flights to the US using smaller Boeing 737 planes from the likes of Belfast and Edinburgh. Mr Calder said that move would put even more pressure on traditional airlines such as BA and Iberia. Loizos Heracleous, a professor of strategy at Warwick Business School, said budget airlines had far lower costs than longer-established competitors, meaning they were more profitable.\"IAG\'s decision to expand with a separate low-cost brand safeguards the image of its flag-carrier brands,\" he said. \"The real trick will be to start Level on as high an efficiency point as possible, this being a crucial factor that distinguishes winners and losers in the budget airline sector.\"Last month in annual profits to 1. 8bn euros (£1. 4bn), helped by lower fuel prices. Shares in IAG were flat at 571. 1p on Friday but have risen by almost 30\% since the start of the year, valuing the company at more than £12bn. ',business
'Sesame Street welcomes Julia, a muppet with autism Its much-loved muppets Big Bird, Cookie Monster, and Oscar the Grouch have been charming viewers for almost 50 years. And now the children\'s TV show Sesame Street is introducing a new muppet character with a simpler name, and a tougher brief. Julia, a little girl, has orange hair, a toy rabbit - and autism. She will make her Sesame Street TV debut in April on US channels HBO and PBS. The character . However, bosses want to step up her role. Autism diagnoses have risen steadily in recent years to a rate of one in every 68 US children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But explaining the topic to a young audience is far from straightforward.\'She ignores Big Bird\' \"The big discussion right at the start was, \'How do we do this? How do we talk about autism?\'\" Sesame Street writer Christine Ferraro told the CBS News show 60 Minutes.\"It\'s tricky because autism is not one thing, because it is different for every single person who has autism.\"In her debut episode, Julia will demonstrate some common characteristics. When Big Bird is introduced to her, she ignores him. Confused, Big Bird thinks \"that maybe she didn\'t like me\". But the other muppets tell him: \"She does things just a little differently.\" Later, when a group of children are playing tag, Julia starts jumping up and down with excitement. \"That\'s a thing that can be typical of some kids with autism,\" Ms Ferraro said. Instead of rejecting Julia, the children create a new game in which they all jump around together. Julia\'s puppeteer, Stacey Gordon, happens to be the mother of an autistic son. She said the creation of an autistic muppet is \"huge\". \"Had my son\'s friends been exposed to his behaviours through something that they had seen on TV before they experienced them in the classroom, they might not have been frightened,\" she told 60 Minutes. \"They might not have been worried when he cried. They would have known that he plays in a different way, and that that\'s OK.\"At this point it\'s not known if Julia will become a major character on the show, but Ms Ferraro - who has been writing it for 25 years - is keen.\"I would love her to be not Julia, the kid on Sesame Street who has autism,\" she said. \"I would like her to be just Julia.\"',entertainment
'Brexit: Heseltine vows to rebel in Lords bill debate Senior Tory Lord Heseltine has said he will rebel against the government when peers debate the bill giving Theresa May the authority to trigger Brexit. He said he would support an opposition amendment in the House of Lords demanding MPs get a meaningful vote on the deal reached with the EU., he denied this would be a \"confrontation\". But Home Secretary Amber Rudd told ITV\'s Peston on Sunday programme: \"I hope he will reconsider.\" Last week peers gave an unopposed second reading to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, following a two-day debate involving more than 180 speakers. MPs have already backed the proposed law, authorising Prime Minister Theresa May to inform the EU of the UK\'s intention to leave. Opposition peers want to amend the bill at a later date to guarantee the rights of EU citizens in Britain and the role of Parliament in scrutinising the process. As the government does not have a majority in the Lords, it is vulnerable to being outvoted if opposition peers - including Labour\'s 202 and the 102 Lib Dems - join forces. Mrs May has said she wants to invoke Article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty - the formal two-year mechanism by which a member state must leave the EU - by the end of March, and the government has warned the House of Lords not to frustrate the process. Lord Heseltine wrote in the Mail on Sunday: \"The fightback starts here. My opponents will argue that the people have spoken, the [Brexit] mandate secured and the future cast. My experience stands against this argument.\"He also wrote: \"This is not a confrontation with the government. It is to ensure the Commons can exercise its authority over the defining issue of our time.\"\'Plenty of opportunity\' The former deputy prime minister, whose leadership challenge to Margaret Thatcher helped trigger her exit from Number 10 in 1990, campaigned for Remain in the run-up to the referendum. He has been a long-standing supporter of the EU within the Conservative Party and backed the idea of the UK joining the single currency. Ms Rudd said: \"The fact is the House of Commons, which he was such a fantastic member of in his time, did pass it by a big majority \"I hope he will reconsider. There\'ll be plenty of opportunities to debate.\" Labour backed the government in backing the bill in the Commons. In a speech to the Scottish Labour Party conference in Perth, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"I accept that Brexit has unleashed uncertainty, instability and concern amongst many, many people. But we cannot simply wish away the result.\"Can you imagine the reaction from those 17 million people, including one million from Scotland, who voted to leave the European Union if we simply ignored them?\" However, Gina Miller, the investment manager who brought the successful legal challenge against the government, forcing the Article 50 issue to a vote in Parliament, accused the Commons of \"cowardice\" in giving the bill a \"rubber stamp\". She told : \"I am hoping the Lords actually do what they should be doing constitutionally, exercising their parliamentary sovereignty, being independent, scrutinising the government and looking to put in amendments.\"Appearing on BBC One\'s Andrew Marr Show, she also said: \"The will of the people does not negate the weight or wisdom of the Houses of Parliament.\"But Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin told the same programme: \"The bill got an overwhelming majority, one of the biggest majorities a bill has got on its third reading in the House of Commons and it\'s gone to the House of Lords. \"The prime minister has said that there will be a vote once the negotiations are concluded. The prime minister won\'t conclude the negotiations if she thinks she\'s got a bad deal.\"The Leader of the House of Commons, David Lidington, told BBC Radio 4\'s The Westminster Hour: \"We\'ll listen, with respect as always, to the Lords when they debate the bill.\" But he added that he hoped peers would not amend it, suggesting that to do so would go against the will of the people: \"I still hope that the Lords will, at the end of the day, accept that this bill is in a particular position, unusual position, because of the referendum result.\"Richard Tice, co-chairman of the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave campaign, said: \"It is of little surprise that Lord Heseltine - who has historically put the interests of the European Union ahead of those of Britain - will try to sabotage Article 50.\"Lord Heseltine\'s attempt to weaken the position of the prime minister ahead of negotiations with the EU is a truly unpatriotic act.\"',politics
'Tomorrow\'s cities: Are your shoes giving away data? Shops and retailers are taking over where street cameras left off, watching shoppers\' every move. According to a 2015 survey of 150 retail executives from IT services firm Computer Services Corporation, a quarter of all British shops and 59\% of fashion retailers use facial recognition software. Such technology is vital as offline stores attempt to keep up with online retailers, said Duncan Mann, chief operating officer at retail analysis firm Hoxton Analytics. \"Online retailers gather all kinds of information about shoppers and physical stores also want to understand how people behave in a shop,\" he said. But, he admits: \"A lot of these technologies are kind of invasive.\" Hoxton has come up with a novel way of measuring footfall - literally by filming people\'s shoes. Sherlock Holmes-like, its system can deduce a remarkable amount of information such as age, gender and social class of shoppers from their footwear.\"We have cameras at about 50cm off the ground and it points down so it is less invasive than facial recognition,\" he explains. It is surprisingly accurate. It spots the correct gender 80\% of the time, better than some facial recognition technologies, according to Mr Mann. Urban efficiency Cities are getting fuller - 70\% of the world\'s population will live in urban areas by 2050 - but don\'t think for a minute that means you will be able to get lost in the crowd. Because those cities are most likely watching you. Plugged into the network - via smart CCTV cameras that feed into central operation centres or smart street lights that turn brighter when someone walks beneath them - cities are increasingly collecting data on their inhabitants. The purpose is to keep people safe, provide more efficient services and prevent overcrowding or other disasters but has anyone ever asked its citizens whether they want to be part of the urban efficiency experiment or offered them ways to opt out of the networked city? \"Very few of us have any real concept of what data smart cities are gathering,\" said Renate Samson of privacy watchdog Big Brother Watch.\"Some of it may be completely anodyne and simply a reaction to a physical movement, but with the increase of devices connected to the internet, the chances are that street lamp, CCTV camera, wi-fi connection, electronic keypad, touch and go payment device, is capturing data on you, your movements, device data and personal information.\"You begin leaking data as soon as you wake up. Maybe you check Twitter before you leave the house to find out if your train is running - that tweet immediately becomes public property - or perhaps you are signed up to navigation apps such as Waze, that crowdsource real-time information about problems on the roads. Apps collect and share lots of personal information and, in its privacy guide, Waze states that it will collect periodically \"all of the phone numbers which are stored on your device\'s phonebook\", as part of a feature to connect you to your friends. And once you enter the transport system you are giving away even more details about yourself. The ticket gate is waiting to swallow your data, via the swipe of a smart card, mobile phone or credit card. Transport for London (TfL) now has a bird\'s eye view of the estimated 4. 1 million journeys taken on its network each day. It knows where people get on and off and it can start to see patterns in the data - for instance, someone who uses the system during the day but not at peak times is likely to be a student or a retired person, someone who has one day a week when they don\'t use the network may work from home that day, someone who takes a brief diversion along their usual route may be dropping off a child at nursery.\"The data can be used to inform future expansion, whether we need to add a bus route or increase the frequency of trains, to alleviate capacity issues by informing people about the most crowded times and places and generally helps us to understand customers better,\" said Gabriel Goulet Langlois, a data scientist at TfL. It can offer automatic refunds if people accidentally tap out with their Oyster card and could be used to alert customers when stations are closed or overcrowded. TFL data was instrumental in solving one of the most notorious crimes of the decade - the Hatton Garden jewellery robbery - when an Oyster pass was found in one of the suspect\'s wallet, throwing light on how the heist was planned. Mr Langlois is keen to point out that, while the police might want to track individual journeys, TFL does not.\"We only want to see aggregated patterns,\" he said. He has been working on a project that can classify travellers, spotting commuters, visitors and even students by their travel patterns. Big data in cities has to be handled increasingly sensitively, thinks Nick Millman, managing director at consultancy firm Accenture. He cites the example of Google which is currently using Google Map data to assess the traffic flow in Stockholm as part of its Better Cities programme.\"It is using what is known as differential privacy,\" he explained. \"It is basically adding privacy controls to statistics so that you only see the data you need to know about. In the case of Stockholm, that means sufficient data to improve traffic but not so much that it reveals individual journey patterns. CCTV cameras are a much more obvious city spy and they now dominate the urban landscape. Numbers from security firm IHS suggest that there were 245 million professionally installed video surveillance cameras active and operational globally in 2014 as more cities turn to monitoring technology to help reduce crime and anti-social behaviour. Security firm Thales has installed 15, 000 security cameras in Mexico City since 2009, which feed into operation centres around the city, including pop-up mobile surveillance centres for big events. Thales boast that it is the world\'s \"most ambitious urban security project \" and claims that since installation, it has seenCrime rates reduced by 48. 9\% Average response times down from 12 to 2: 09 minutes Insurance premiums down by 30\% 50\% of stolen cars recovered within 72 hours (thanks to number plate reading technology) But in the UK, some local authorities are scaling back on their CCTV usage, according to a recent report from Big Brother Watch.\"More and more councils are scrapping their CCTV systems due to budgetary constraints. In some cases councils have removed CCTV because the systems have no longer been necessary, crime has either moved to another area or the cameras have been of such poor quality they haven\'t provided any substantial benefit,\" said Ms Samson.',tech
'BT fined record £42m for late installations BT has been hit with a £42m fine from telecoms regulator Ofcom and will also pay £300m to corporate customers for delays in installing high-speed lines. Ofcom said the fine was the largest it had ever handed down. It found BT\'s Openreach division had cut compensation payments to telecoms providers for delays in installing the lines between early 2013 and late 2014. Openreach chief executive Clive Selley said the firm for the mistakes. The investigation found BT had broken rules put in place to counter its \"significant market power\" by cutting the payments. Gaucho Rasmussen, Ofcom\'s investigations director, said: \"These high-speed lines are a vital part of this country\'s digital backbone. \"We found BT broke our rules by failing to pay other telecoms companies proper compensation when these services were not provided on time. \"The size of our fine reflects how important these rules are to protect competition and, ultimately, consumers and businesses.\" \'Appropriate notice\' Openreach provides the wires and cables that powers the UK\'s broadband and landline phone network. In this case, it failed to pay full compensation to providers when it was late installing ethernet lines - high-speed cables used by large businesses, and mobile and broadband providers, to transmit data. BT is supposed to roll out high-speed lines within 30 days. If it cannot do that then it can give notice and say it needs a little longer, and that is acceptable under the rules. However, Mr Rasmussen said that if BT did not provide \"appropriate notice\" it had to pay compensation to its telecoms provider customers for the delay.\"We have found in our investigation that that notice was not always appropriately provided and that BT would go back in time to try and justify its delay to avoid paying compensation.\"BT was also fined an extra £300, 000 for not providing Ofcom with all the information it asked for. \"We have powers to compel companies to provide us information and it\'s important that that information is provided to us both on time and in complete manner,\" said Mr Rasmussen.\"We found that sometimes there were delays, sometimes information was incomplete and that obviously has an impact on how quickly we can do our job.\"\'Fall short\' Earlier this month, BT agreed to Ofcom\'s demands for it to legally separate Openreach from its main business. Under the changes, Openreach will become a distinct company with its own staff, management and strategy \"to serve all of its customers equally\". BT chief executive Gavin Patterson said Ofcom\'s investigation \"revealed we fell short of the high standards\" for serving telecoms providers.\"We take this issue very seriously and we have put in place measures, controls and people to prevent it happening again,\" he said.

'After Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, is Daniel Radcliffe ready for Hamlet? Daniel Radcliffe says he is really keen to be in a Shakespeare play - although he admits he\'s no expert on the Bard. The Harry Potter star has been praised for his latest role in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead at London\'s Old Vic. Tom Stoppard\'s comedy, first performed in 1966, centres around two minor characters from Hamlet.\"My knowledge of Shakespeare is pretty limited,\" Radcliffe told the BBC after Tuesday\'s opening night. \"In this company, we\'ve been talking about Hamlet a lot. And I am by far one of the least educated people on Shakespeare and Hamlet.\" The 27-year-old actor said he didn\'t want to tackle a Shakespearean role for the sake of it. \"I never want to be feeling like I want to do that role so I can tick it off a list. \"There has to be something about the role or production that feels vital, that I feel I could bring something to. \"With Hamlet, there\'s a part of me that says I\'ve seen Jude Law and Ben Whishaw do this and they were great. I don\'t know what I would bring to it.\"He added with a laugh: \"You can throw this quote back at me in a few years when I\'m playing Hamlet!\"Radcliffe\'s previous stage plays include Equus, Privacy and The Cripple of Inishmaan.

'Will EU data protection safeguards be kept post Brexit? The rules that govern how our personal data can be used, where it can be stored, and who can see it, are, at the moment, written by the European Union but what will happen when we leave the EU? The next time you fill your name and other information into a box on a website remember this: when you do it, you are transferring data about yourself. But what will happen when we leave the EU? Data is not just a commodity for the likes of Google and Facebook to sell on. It can also be a cure. At the moment, scientists are taking part in a study of how cancer is affected by lifestyle and diet. The project is called Epic, and it is one of many research projects that rely on moving large amounts of data around the EU. \"The data can move freely between the researchers,\" says Beth Thompson, senior policy adviser at the health charity, the Wellcome Trust. Right now, much of her time is taken up working out whether that will still be the case when we leave the EU. You might think data is the ultimate borderless commodity, but how it moves is governed by rules made in Europe. Imagine you\'re a Liverpudlian tax specialist offering online services to British expats living in Spain. Or an Edinburgh children\'s toy-maker marketing products in Germany. When a customer fills in your online form and gives you data about themselves, you\'re legally covered because the UK is part of the system of EU data laws. The rules we operate under at the moment were drawn up more than 20 years ago, well before the advent of social media. New EU rules will come into force next year, and the UK will have to implement them. A year later we leave the Union, and then it will be up to the European Commission to decide whether it believes the UK meets EU standards - whether we are deemed to be \"adequate\". \"Adequacy is something equivalent to EU standards,\" says Chris Pounder, a lawyer at information specialists Amberhawk, with 30 years\' experience in data protection. Would we get adequacy? \"Already the Europeans are concerned about the level of protection afforded by the [current British] Data Protection Act.\" He believes that if this continues when we implement the new data rules next year we are not going to get adequacy. It\'s not just Britain\'s data relationship with the EU that is at stake here. \"Because we are part of the European Union we trade data with the United States as part of something called Privacy Shield,\" says Stephanie Hare, a political risk analyst who specialises in technology. When we leave the EU we will leave that data-sharing arrangement, as we will the EU\'s other arrangements with Canada, New Zealand and the like. Stephanie Hare says in the future Britain will probably mirror the way non-EU countries currently do it.\"They have to go to these third-party agreements. It\'s really expensive, it\'s bureaucratically heavy, it becomes an added cost for business.\" \'De facto compliance\' Those costs would exist for researchers too. Beth Thompson, at the Wellcome Trust, isn\'t worried about data flows stopping, but \"if we don\'t have adequacy the researchers in other EU countries who want to transfer their data to the UK will have to go through a series of hurdles and that will make the UK a less attractive place to do research.\" Some argue we will not end up in that sort of situation. Paul Lindsell co-founded the Data Governance Forum, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to promoting best practice. He says firms have to comply with the new EU rules at least until the point of Brexit. \"Since the government is unlikely to waste time on unpicking data protection legislation post-Brexit, the vast majority of corporations will have become compliant.\"The result is de facto compliance. \'Adequacy\' of legislation is almost sure to remain.\"That would be the easiest scenario, but before then, organisations must plan for a more complicated future, even if that\'s not what emerges in the end.',politics
'Uber pledges to make drivers happier Uber\'s relationship with its drivers has become increasingly strained, the company admitted on Tuesday, as it vowed to improve its service. The ride-sharing firm told the media some of its policies were \"unintentionally stacked against drivers\". In particular, drivers for the company will now have more ability to defend themselves against rider complaints and refunds. Uber also spoke about its continuing investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and \"toxic\" working culture. The news follows the recent departure of the company\'s president Jeff Jones, who said the \"beliefs and approach\" at Uber were \"inconsistent\" with his own views. Part of Mr Jones\'s job at the company had been to manage the relationship between the company and its drivers. Mr Jones held a Q+A session with drivers in February which provoked angry responses - one driver remarked: \"The ONLY thing you made clear to the majority of us is that you don\'t have ANY productive answers.\"Real-time ID Rachel Holt, who manages Uber\'s operations in the US and Canada, conceded that the firm had underinvested in the driver experience and that the firm was now \"re-examining everything we do\". Last month, Uber\'s embattled chief executive Travis Kalanick was recorded arguing with a driver about falling fares. The incident prompted Mr Kalanick to admit he needed \"leadership help\". The company later announced it was hiring a chief operating officer. Central to Uber\'s plan to appease its drivers is giving more weight to their own defence in the face of customer complaints. Ms Holt cited the example of a driver in Toronto who had worked more than 8, 000 trips - but after receiving just three complaints was barred from using the service (though he was later reinstated). Ms Holt said drivers who had amassed a long history of trips would be treated differently to a newer driver.\"We need to bring more humanity to the way we interact with drivers,\" Ms Holt said in a call with reporters.\"We\'re updating many customer support policies that were unintentionally stacked against drivers.\"We also need to give drivers a say in fare adjustments instead of relying on what a rider tells us.\"However, the promises fell short of what many drivers have been calling for.\"If Uber truly cares about \'growing up\' and listening to drivers, they should start by adding a tipping option,\" said Ryan Price from the Independent Drivers\' Guild, an organisation that represents ride-sharing workers in New York. \"That\'s the number one request from drivers.\"Rival services such as Lyft allow riders to use the app to tip drivers after a ride has completed - but Uber has so far rejected adding the option. Sexism update In February Uber was rocked by a former employee\'s devastating assessment of her time working at the company. She detailed several instances of sexual harassment and a culture that did not welcome women. In response, Uber announced it would launch an investigation led by Eric Holder, who served under President Barack Obama as attorney-general, the highest ranking law enforcement in the US. Liane Hornsey, Uber\'s new head of human resources, said more than 100 \"listening sessions\" had taken place across the company.\"The focus of the company has been on the business and not the employees,\" she told reporters. She said the atmosphere at the company had created a \"cult of the individual\". The company reiterated its promise to release a report on diversity at Uber by the end of this month.',tech
'S Korea complains to WTO about China over Thaad South Korea has appealed to the World Trade Organization to determine if the Chinese government is treating South Korean companies unfairly. Seoul claims Beijing is retaliating economically over its deployment of a US anti-missile defence system. South Korea\'s Trade Minister Joo Hyung-hwan told parliament China \"may be in violation of some trade agreements\". China opposes the deployment, saying it will affect the regional security balance and allow the US to spy on it. Washington and Seoul say the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system is designed to protect against threats from North Korea. But it has caused significant tension with China, which is South Korea\'s largest trading partner. \"The Chinese government may not admit that they took retaliatory measures against the Thaad decision, but we have to point out the possibility,\" Mr Joo said .\"We are collecting evidence and will also deal with issues that South Korean companies are treated unfairly in China.\"South Korea complained about China to the WTO over the issue on Friday, Mr Joo said. What is the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System (Thaad)? Shoots down short and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase of their flight Uses hit-to-kill technology - where kinetic energy destroys the incoming warhead Has a range of 200km and can reach an altitude of 150km US has previously deployed it in Guam and Hawaii as a measure against potential attacks from North Korea China\'s leaders have voiced serious displeasure over the Thaad system and its deployment has generated . The row has coincided with a number of economic measures being imposed on South Korea. China\'s National Tourism Administration ordered local travel agencies to stop selling tour packages to South Korea starting 15 March, according to Korea\'s Tourism Organisation.\"Some estimates suggest that Beijing\'s travel ban could reduce the number of Chinese visitors to South Korea by up to 70\%, resulting in billions of dollars in lost tourism-related revenue,\" Scott Seaman, director of Asia at the Eurasia Group, said. China froze the sale and distribution of some South Korean television dramas, music and products starting last October. Nearly all shows or music concerts starring Korean artists have been suspended. Chinese authorities have also closed dozens of stores belonging to South Korea\'s Lotte Group, which has signed a deal to provide land to host the Thaad system, for allegedly violating safety regulations. China denies the recent moves are related to the Thaad deployment. In a separate development, the Lotte Group\'s 93-year-old founder and three other family members went on trial in Seoul on Monday for alleged embezzlement, tax evasion and fraud. Tong Zhao, a fellow from the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, believes China\'s economic pressure may ultimately prove counter-productive.\"Threats of economic sanctions are part of coercive diplomacy, but they may not be useful in addressing the Thaad issue,\" .\"These forceful measures would likely be seen as a sign of disrespect and a direct threat to South Korea\'s interests - which could ultimately push South Korea to bolster its military alliance with the United States\".',business
'Tate Modern drew record visitor numbers in 2016 A million more people visited Tate Modern in 2016 compared with the previous year. More than 5. 8 million people went to the London gallery in 2016, an increase of 24\%, making it the third most visited attraction in the UK. No doubt visitors were drawn to Tate Modern\'s new 10-storey extension, the Switch House, which opened in June. The British Museum was the most popular visitor attraction in Britain in 2016 for the 10th year running. The figures come from the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (ALVA). Top 10 UK attractions: The British Museum had more than 6. 4 million visits - but that was a 5. 9\% drop on the previous year. The top 10 most-visited attractions in the country were all in the capital. Seven of those saw a fall in numbers, including The Natural History Museum and the V&amp; A, which both suffered a drop of 12\%. The overall visitor numbers for London attractions last year were level.\'Security fears\' Bernard Donoghue, director of the ALVA, said terrorist attacks in European cities last year had made some people reluctant to visit major cities. He told the Press Association: \"There were some security fears about central London and city centre attractions, both on the part of overseas visitors and also UK domestic families.\"We did see a displacement out of central London for some people going to visitor attractions.\"In England, excluding London, there was an increase of 5. 9\%. with 15. 6\%, while Wales\'s figures went up by 11\%.

'Morgan: Osborne\'s liberal Conservatism will be heard Ex-Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has defended George Osborne\'s appointment as Evening Standard editor, warning cabinet ministers fired by Theresa May will have their \"voices heard\". Mrs Morgan, who lost her job after Mrs May became PM, said sacked ministers are not just going to \"disappear\". The rules on MPs taking second jobs are to be discussed by a government watchdog on ethical standards. The committee will meet on Thursday in the wake of Mr Osborne\'s appointment. But Mrs Morgan said if the Committee on Standards in Public Life is going to ban MPs from having outside jobs, \"we\'re going to have to stop MPs being ministers\". \'We will be heard\' She claimed Mr Osborne had been \"a very good constituency MP while he was chancellor\", which she described as \"the ultimate second job\", adding: \"We want talented, interesting people to take on these big jobs.\"But she told ITV\'s Robert Peston: \"George is very much about being the voice of the liberal Conservative party. When you\'re fired as we all were last summer, what did they expect, the government? That we all just going to disappear? \"No, we are going to make our voices heard, whether it\'s me writing articles, whether it\'s George being editor of the Evening Standard. \"There\'s a liberal Conservatism point of view to be talked about and we\'re going to do that.\"\'Taking on too much\'? Former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair also defended Mr Osborne\'s appointment, telling BBC One\'s Andrew Marr: \"I don\'t know whether having those jobs is doable or not, but I think it is a great thing for the Evening Standard. Why not? He is a highly capable guy and it should make politics more interesting.\" But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told the same show: \"I thought well \'he\'s a better man than me\' - because I spent 10 years as a journalist and six years as a politician and I\'m not sure I could combine them both... so I\'m not sure you can do both at the same time, if I\'m honest.\"Former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who writes a column in the Evening Standard, told the BBC\'s Sunday Politics he had not spoken to Mr Osborne about his new role, but warned \"he\'s taking a lot on\".\"He\'s not only wanting to be an editor, he wants to continue being an MP in the north of England, to be a jet-setting academic in the United States, to earn a lot of money in the city... I suspect something will give. \"Even by George Osborne\'s self confident standards in his own abilities, I suspect he\'s taking on a little too much.\"Unqualified? Labour MP Stephen Kinnock told ITV\'s Robert Peston: \"When I first read this I thought it was fake news and sort of choked on my cornflakes.\"I think it\'s completely unsustainable. One of the worrying things is: \'will the Evening Standard become the propaganda arm of the Conservative Party?\' Conflicts of interest all over the place.\" But Conservative MP for Wimbledon, Stephen Hammond, defended Mr Osborne as \"an extremely talented individual\".\"I think it is a surprise to a lot of people, but against that, we in London need as many people in London to stand up for us as we can - and I think George will ensure that\'s true,\" he saidMr Osborne also faces criticism for not getting Cabinet Office approval before taking the post. More than 100 MPs currently declare additional employment, ranging from lawyers and doctors to farmers and dentists. But Lord Bew, who chairs the committee, said it would discuss whether the rules needed to be changed following the announcement on Friday that Mr Osborne was going to edit London\'s free evening paper. As well as being MP for Tatton, Cheshire, his latest job is in addition to his work as: An after-dinner speaker in the US Chairman of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership Adviser to fund management firm Blackrock A fellow at the McCain Institute Lord Bew, whose committee advises the prime minister on ethical standards for people in public office, said of Mr Osborne\'s editorship: \"We had something that, up to a degree, worked. It now seems to be getting into rockier waters.\"Unless someone sleeps two hours a night, that\'s the only way I can see how this is not [too much]. \"This is not personal to George Osborne. But [his case] raises the issue of how much time MPs have to devote to their parliamentary work.\"Polling suggests public attitudes have hardened against MPs taking second jobs - but there is also a desire for fewer career politicians. Since 2010, as a compromise, MPs have had to tell voters if they intend to hold a second job when elections are held. But now, in light of Mr Osborne\'s workload, Lord Bew has told the BBC that his committee, which suggested that compromise, will later this week debate whether MPs should be allowed the option of a second job at all. The editorship announcement also came before Mr Osborne had received approval from the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, or Acoba. The body, within the Cabinet Office, is responsible for approving jobs taken by former ministers up to two years after they leave office. Labour MP and shadow minister Andrew Gwynne has written to John Manzoni, the permanent secretary to the Cabinet Office, urging him to examine whether there was a breach of the Ministerial Code of Conduct.',politics
'IBM\'s online quantum machine gets faster IBM has made its quantum computing system commercially available to businesses and beefed up an existing system used by the research community. The firm is hoping to boost the numbers of people able to use such computers. The machine, based in New York, has been available via the internet since May last year. Future applications include the discovery of new materials and medicines as well as making artificial intelligence much more powerful. Tricky problem Since the system went online last year, more than 40, 000 users have run over 275, 000 experiments on it. While the system it has made publicly available is currently only as powerful as a standard laptop, it is an important first step, said IBM scientist Dr Jerry Chow.\"It is about growing an eco-system of users, developing a community that can grow and define the software that will run it,\" he explained. He added that the system now includes an interface which allows programmers to launch instructions for the machine using traditional programming languages. Traditional computers process all their information using bits - information stored in tiny transistors that can either be on or off - interpreted as values of one and zero. Quantum computing instead takes advantage of a mechanism called super-positioning that allows quantum bits - or \"qubits\" - to have values of one, zero, or both at the same time. But the real power of quantum computing lies in a concept known as entanglement - whereby bits can interfere and interact with each other, creating many states. Qubits are, by their nature, massively unstable and maintaining even one is tricky. Most agree that when quantum computing hits 50 qubits - more powerful than the most powerful supercomputers currently available - that will be something of a magic number. IBM\'s quantum computer will now offer simulation of 20 qubits, up from its original five, which gives the machine the equivalent power of an average laptop.\"Classical computers are extraordinarily powerful and will continue to advance and underpin everything we do in business and society,\" said Tom Rosamilia, senior vice president of IBM Systems. \"But there are many problems that will never be penetrated by a classical computer. To create knowledge from much greater depths of complexity, we need a quantum computer.\" One computing expert who has used IBM\'s technology said it showed promise.\"Whilst it is still relatively limited, it is allowing many of us to gain practical experience of running quantum algorithms,\" said Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey.\"The recent improvements are a natural consequence of the community of users expanding and resulting demand for such improvements.\"It is important to note that quantum computers have the potential for extraordinary speed increases but only in certain types of algorithms.\"The correct time to commercialise such a facility is still open to debate, but there is a market developing with other companies such as DWave already selling their form of quantum computer. So, it\'s not surprising for IBM to want to capitalise on its progress.\"',tech
'G20 finance ministers drop anti-protectionist pledge Finance ministers from the world\'s biggest economies have dropped an anti-protectionist commitment after opposition from the US. G20 ministers left the two-day meeting without renewing their long-standing pledge to bolster free trade. Last year, the group of the world\'s 20 largest economies vowed to \"resist all forms of protectionism\". But since then, President Donald Trump has taken office, and is aggressively pursuing an \"America First\" policy. His policies include penalties for companies which manufacture their products abroad. Speaking after the meeting ended, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he would not read too much into his country\'s desire to change the language behind the communique, as \"what was as in the past\" releases was \"not relevant\". Mr Mnuchin added he had been \"very clear that we do believe in free trade but we believe in balanced trade\". The communique, which was published at the end of the meeting in Baden-Baden with the agreement of all attending delegates, also failed to include a vow on climate change. Mr Trump has already promised to slash environmental funding. The exclusion of the two issues in the communique was disappointing, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said.\"I regret that our discussions today were unable to reach a satisfying conclusion on two absolutely essential priorities that our world and which France would have liked to see the G20 continue to take firm and concerted action on.\"However, it did include pledges on a determination to fight tax avoidance, clamp down on terrorist financing and strengthen private investment in Africa. Reaching an impasse: Joe Miller, BBC News, Baden-Baden It started so well. With the sun shining in the German spa town of Baden-Baden, the first annual meeting of the G20 got under way with a reassurance from the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that the White House was not interested in instigating international trade wars. The combined efforts of Germany, and nascent free-trade champions China, it was thought, would temper some of Washington\'s threats of imposing punishing border tariffs and renegotiating long-standing trade agreements. But two days later, the communique approved by all the assembled finance ministers was published without a commitment to bolster free trade and dropped a pledge to \"resist all forms of protectionism\" from the previous year\'s document. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said the meeting had reached an impasse when it came to the issue, and added that his counterparts could not \"force partners\" - read the United States - \"to go along with wording with which they don\'t agree\". Mr Schauble insisted that there had been \"a lot of goodwill\" at the meeting, but whether that goodwill extends to the future trade relationship with the world\'s largest economy is now very much in doubt.',business
'Sir Bruce Forsyth due to return home from intensive care Sir Bruce Forsyth is due to return home later after spending five nights in intensive care following a severe chest infection. The 89-year-old\'s manager said he had been in St Peter\'s Hospital in Surrey since Sunday.\"Sir Bruce Forsyth is scheduled to return home from hospital later today and would like to thank everyone for their good wishes,\" Ian Wilson said. He added the entertainer thanked hospital staff for their care.\"[Sir Bruce] and his family would also like to say a special thank you to all the NHS doctors, nurses and staff at St Peter\'s Hospital for their kindness and care.\" In 2015, the presenter underwent keyhole surgery after suffering two aneurysms, which were discovered when tests were carried out following a fall at his Surrey home. Sir Bruce left Strictly Come Dancing in 2014, having presented it since the first series, but his manager denied reports last October that he had retired from the entertainment industry. At the time, Mr Wilson said Sir Bruce was \"recuperating from various health issues\", adding: \"His sole focus at the moment is to continue getting better and he has made no formal or informal decision about retiring from showbusiness.\"Sir Bruce has not been seen in public recently, and was too frail to attend the funerals of close friends Ronnie Corbett and Sir Terry Wogan last year.

'Article 50: Brexit deal must meet six tests, says Labour Labour will not support any Brexit deal negotiated by the government unless it meets the party\'s \"six tests\", the shadow Brexit secretary has said. Any deal must include a strong relationship with the EU and the same benefits the UK currently has from the single market, Sir Keir Starmer said. The UK should \"honour our obligations\" regarding any \"divorce bill\", he added. The government will trigger Article 50 on Wednesday, kick-starting talks aimed at agreeing a Brexit deal with the EU. The government will then publish its Great Repeal Bill on Thursday. It will propose giving ministers the powers to change some aspects of European laws when they have been incorporated into UK legislation, without needing the approval of Parliament. Triggering Article 50 begins a two-year negotiation process to attempt to reach a deal before Britain officially leaves the EU in March 2019. If no deal is agreed, it would mean World Trade Organization rules would be imposed - less favourable terms than trading within the single market. Outlining Labour\'s demands in a speech in London, Sir Keir said the prime minister \"should be under no illusion\" and added that Labour would not support a deal \"that fails to reflect core British values and the six tests I have set out today\". \"All of us want the best for Britain. But the stakes are high and the prime minister\'s approach so far does not bode well,\" he said. The BBC\'s assistant political editor Norman Smith said some of the tests were akin to \"motherhood and apple pie\" and could be met quite easily. But he said Labour were setting the bar quite high in calling for the UK to retain the \"exact same benefits\" as currently afforded by membership of the single market and the customs union. Labour\'s six tests for a Brexit deal Fair migration system for UK business and communities Retaining strong, collaborative relationship with EU Protecting national security and tackling cross-border crime Delivering for all nations and regions of the UK Protecting workers\' rights and employment protections Ensuring same benefits currently enjoyed within single market In demanding this, Sir Keir said Labour was only seeking the same objective that Brexit Secretary David Davis had set himself in Parliament. \"The government can\'t turn around and say this is unachievable because it was David Davis... who said that,\" he said. Another key demand is for \"fair management of migration in the interests of the economy and communities\". Sir Keir said he accepted that the EU principle of freedom of movement \"has to go\" but he insisted a future immigration policy must be one of managed migration which works for businesses and communities. One of the tests calls for \"a strong collaborative future relationship with the EU\". He said it was important to state that because \"some of the pure Brexiteers actually want us to crash out [without a deal], either at the Article 50 stage in two years or before that\".\"This is the worst of all possible outcomes,\" he added, saying there would be greater certainty if Theresa May agreed to transitional arrangements from 29 March 2019 until a treaty setting out future relations was finally signed. \'Sniping\' Responding to Sir Keir\'s intervention, Conservative MP Maria Caulfield said Labour were divided over the UK\'s future outside of the EU and merely \"sniping from the sidelines\".\"They can\'t even agree on whether they want to control immigration, and have today failed to make ending uncontrolled free movement one of their tests for supporting a deal with the EU,\" she said. No 10 said it wanted the \"greatest possible access\" to the single market. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker suggested last week that the UK may have to pay up to £50bn for privileged access to the single market and customs union. Asked about this on Sunday, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said business wanted the \"widest possible access\" to the single market but how much this would cost would form part of the negotiations. She also dismissed a \"no deal\" scenario outlined by EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier - with truck queues at Dover, disruption to air traffic and a suspension in the movement of nuclear materials to the UK - as \"apocalyptic\".\"I think it\'s fair to say I don\'t recognise that description... he would say that wouldn\'t he?\" she said. It has been reported the Great Repeal Bill will include proposals for the government to be given a \"new time-limited correcting power\" which would allow changes to be made through so-called Henry VIII clauses - without needing the approval of Parliament. The government says it needs the power to make \"technical\" changes quickly as a lot of EU law will not work properly without changes being made but Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says he will not allow Parliament to be \"overridden\" and ministers to issue a \"series of diktats\".

'Google\'s crisis of confidence Matt Brittin\'s appearance at a London advertising conference could not have been better timed - for the watching journalists at least. Google\'s European boss took to the stage at Advertising Week Europe just as the storm over hit new heights. The fact that that Marks &amp; Spencer has joined the government and a clutch of other organisations in withdrawing their ads from Google\'s platforms means the search giant is facing a crisis of confidence in its ability to police its service. As Google is effectively the world\'s most lucrative ad business, losing the trust of its customers is a serious matter. So Mr Brittin started by saying sorry: \"We apologise when anything like that happens, we don\'t want it to happen and we take responsibility.\"However, he slightly undermined that by saying the impact on advertisers has often been a matter of pennies, not pounds. In other words, hardly anyone had seen the ads appearing next to the questionable YouTube videos. Clarity challenge Mr Brittin hastily went on to pledge that Google was taking the issue very seriously, investing millions of dollars and employing thousands of people to ensure that \"bad advertising\" does not get through. There are two difficult issues for Google here: spotting videos that are illegal and should be removed from YouTube; and determining which are legal but not suitable to carry advertising. Pressed by reporters on whether the firm would employ people to actively hunt down extremist videos, Mr Brittin was evasive, indicating that a combination of smart technology and user alerts to harmful content was a better option. Yet his main challenge will be in providing more clarity to customers when it comes to deciding which videos are \"ad-safe\". Drawing the line will not be easy. As he pointed out, news organisations put a lot of disturbing content online, but need to earn money from advertising if they are to continue to invest in journalism. Mr Brittin seems confident that by having a thorough look at its policies and showing advertisers how they can control where their messages appear, Google can regain their confidence. The company, which insists it is a technology platform and not a media business, is finding it ever harder to hold that line. Media firms face tight regulation - and that is what could be coming Google\'s way if it fails to clean up its act.',tech
'My Shop: How business rates are hitting home There is growing unease in the business community as it braces itself for England\'s first rate revaluation since 2010. The government is promising help in the Budget, but critics are calling the rates system itself . As the commercial rental value of business premises are brought up to date, there will inevitably be some big losers. (You can learn more about the process .)To get a snapshot \'rate reaction\', we asked six shopkeepers we have previously profiled for our to reveal how they will be affected in April. Some are angry, some pleasantly surprised - and one thinks he knows a better way.\'How will I survive?\' \"Trying to find the extra cash is going to be close to impossible,\" complains Mike Wells. His shop is devoted to male products, from shaving foam to belt buckles. Surprisingly, it attracts a mainly female clientele, looking for gifts for the men in their lives. He is one of the unlucky shopkeepers who will pay more when new business rates kick in. £1, 000 more a year to be exact. This is because the \'rateable value\' of his shop, which he runs alone, has gone up £2, 000 to £17, 250. \"My own personal wage is way below minimum wage,\" he explains, \"and has been at the same level for almost five years, just £4 per hour. How will I survive?\"\"Landlords are generally a greedy bunch and whilst they are happy to raise rents when times are good, they (in my experience) never reduce them when times are hard.\" \"A tax based on a business\'s ability to pay would be much fairer…Oh yes, one of those already exists. Corporation tax.\"\'Pips are squeaking\' Spare a thought for in Portsmouth. He made a Brexit bonus by - but much of those savings will now be needed to pay his rates bill. He is looking at a 44\% rise, as the rateable value of his warehouse-cum-cafe goes up from £18, 997 to £27, 346.\"To stand still I must sell £20, 000 more tea or reduce staffing - that\'s the reality,\" he says. The high value of his large premises means that he has never qualified for any relief - which the government offers to small businesses in lower property bands.\"Effectively this [rate rise] will come out of my pocket, a pay cut for me.\"\"Mrs May says \'Britain is open for business\'. Well the pips are squeaking.\"Crates and rates Not all our shopkeepers are losing out. When he turned 50, Steve Everitt decided to follow his dream and build a in Coventry. In his first year of business, 2015, he was based in an old shipping container in the FarGo Village mall. He did all his paperwork and was pleased to find his crate generated zero rates. However, when he graduated to a more conventional retail space in the mall last year he had to pay £565. It would have been free but retail relief was abolished that year, he recalls sadly. The latest revaluation has returned his rates to zero for 2017. In the new system business properties rated at up to £12, 000 pay zero rates (the threshold used to be £6, 000). It\'s good news for a shop that runs on passion and niche marketing.\'I\'m not sure it\'s fair\' Clothes maker Carin Mansfield also benefits from the threshold change. She makes \'new vintage\', hand-made clothes that are expensive, but she says will last for 50 years - long enough to survive around seven business rate revaluations. Her is near Warren Street in central London - but it\'s tiny and actually doesn\'t get a huge amount of footfall. When it was rated back in 2010, her value was set at £6, 500. She paid around £50 per month to Camden Council, she says. Her new rateable value is £9, 000. Despite the rise, she now doesn\'t have to pay anything.\"I am not sure if it is fair to use the square footage as a calculation [for business rates],\" she says.\"IN-KU has very small square footage, but it works for my purpose.\"\'Don\'t complain\' Ziferblat is a small franchise of that are thriving since expanding outside of London, where commercial rents are cheaper. In these innovative cafes, you can consume as much food, drink and wi-fi as you like - on the clock.\"The effect on us is neutral,\" explains owner Colin Shenton.\"Our rates in Manchester rise by 15\%, in Liverpool it stays the same and in Leeds it drops by a third.\" Having a geographical spread has protected them, as commercial property prices vary across the country.\"It must be fair that a small retailer in a market town pays less than a multinational on Bond Street,\" says Mr Shenton.\"Retailers should not complain,\" he reckons. \"In theory, higher rents should mean higher turnover from their more desirable location.\"What really matters is the multiplier that local councils apply to the valuations, he adds.\'If I won the lottery...\' Jon Sharky\'s in Liverpool\'s St. Quiggins centre is barely big enough to park a van in - in fact it doesn\'t even have solid walls. He\'s chuffed that he\'s been nominated for \'Best New Business\' at this year\'s Liverpool Retail Awards - alongside well-known names such as Victoria\'s Secret. Though business-savvy, he is not entirely sure how his business rates have changed. His significant outgoings are streamlined into one payment he makes to the people who run the shopping mall. It\'s an arrangement he prefers.\"When I was researching potential sites for my business, the cheapest high street units I could find in the city centre started at more than seven times my current annual rent,\" he says. And many of those units still lie empty, he points out.\"If it were up to me, every major city would have a building like ours, filled with small starter units, rented out to young independent entrepreneurs with all major bills included in the rent and then handled by the building owners. \"If I won the lottery, I\'d do it myself!\" or .',business

'Millions of US employee records \'leaked\' Details of more than 33 million US employees - including military staff - have been released online, according to a security researcher. The database is reported to contain information on 100, 000 US Department of Defense employees, among others. Troy Hunt, , said the information had \"enormous\" potential for scammers. Business services firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet confirmed to tech news site ZDNet that it owns the data. Information on government departments and private sector employees is commonly collated by business services that sell the data to other companies, such as marketing firms. In this case, the records - including names, job titles and contact details - were originally compiled by NetProspex, which was acquired by Dun &amp; Bradstreet in 2015. Organisations with employees mentioned in the data include the US Postal Service, telecoms giant AT&amp; T and the retailer Walmart. Mr Hunt pointed out that people might try to use the names and email addresses in the database to scam or retrieve sensitive information from recipients - a practice known as spear phishing.\"The value for very targeted spear phishing is enormous because you can carefully craft messages that refer to specific individuals of influence and their roles within the organisation,\" he wrote on his blog.

Also addicted to crack cocaine, he weighed just 109lb (49kg), and his skin was covered in ulcers.\"I was arrested more times than I can remember [for drug offences],\" says Khalil. \"I was completely messed up... I was always in so much pain that I couldn\'t sleep.\"While Khalil had tried and failed to get clean before, he says that after his ninth overdose he finally realised that he had to change his life in order to save it. So he spent four months in a rehab centre - and has been drug-free ever since. Throwing himself into healthy living, Khalil has been so successful in rebuilding his life that today he is the millionaire founder and owner of fashionable Californian health food business Sunlife Organics. With annual sales of more than $6m (£4. 8m) from its six outlets - which combine juice bars and cafes, and also sell the firm\'s clothing line - and via its website, the company is preparing to expand to 16 other US states and into Japan. Now aged 46 and accustomed to travelling by private jet, he\'s come a long way since his days of sleeping on the streets. In fact, Khalil\'s life story could be the plot of a Hollywood movie. Born in Ohio in the US Midwest, he is the son of a Polish Jewish mother and a Muslim father. A troubled childhood saw him leave school without any qualifications, and get arrested for vandalism and shoplifting. In 1992, aged 21, he moved to Los Angeles with dreams of becoming a movie star. While the acting career never really took off, he started playing in local bands, and made a good living cleaning cars for Hollywood stars including Elizabeth Taylor and Jeff Bridges, and Guns N\' Roses lead guitarist Slash. However, he soon slid into drug addiction, and his life spiralled out of control. Eventually he was sleeping in cardboard boxes beside other junkies, and dealing drugs to help fund his own habit. Then after that fateful ninth overdose Khalil\'s life completely changed for the better. After successfully quitting drugs he kept himself busy by juggling several jobs. In addition to working at two rehab centres in Malibu he washed cars, walked dogs and did gardening work. \"I was able to save money,\" he says. \"I worked hard, seven days a week, 16 hours a day.\"Khalil also started to become obsessed with making his own vegetable and fruit juices after he met an old friend from Ohio.\"He was a little bit like a hippie, and started teaching me about vitamins, organic food, super food,\" says Khalil. \"At that moment I was looking for anything that would make me feel better.\"In 2007 Khalil rented a house and opened his own rehab centre, Riviera Recovery, for clients who would pay $10, 000 a month to stay at the facility. For these residents, Khalil would make exotic juice blends such as one he called Wolverine - a mix of banana, maca powder, royal jelly and pollen. Eventually the reputation of these drinks spread beyond the building, with people calling in to buy them. Realising that there was enough demand to set up a separate business, in 2011 Khalil launched Sunlife Organics, together with his best friend and then-girlfriend. Funding the business from savings, the first branch opened in Malibu. Khalil says it was an instant success, with sales of $1m in its first year. Today the business employs more than 200 people across its six outlets. In addition to juices, it now sells a range of food and clothes, such as t-shirts and hoodies. Rob Nazara, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, says Khalil\'s story shows real strength of character. \"No matter what the educational or professional background someone may have, the success of an entrepreneur is driven by grit, determination and ambition,\" he says. Besides Sunlife Organics, Khalil still runs Riviera Recovery and owns a yoga studio in Malibu. He also made time to write his autobiography, I Forgot To Die, which was released in 2015.\"I don\'t consider myself super intelligent,\" says Khalil. \"But I have a hunger for life, and put all of myself into something when I decide to do it.\"Follow The Boss series editor Will Smale on Twitter ',business
'Children\'s Laureate Chris Riddell up for book prize Children\'s Laureate Chris Riddell has a chance to win the Kate Greenaway illustration medal for a fourth time. Riddell is shortlisted this year for his drawings in A Great Big Cuddle, a book of children\'s poetry by Michael Rosen - a former laureate himself. The poems are all about what it\'s like to be a small child in a world of toys and games and many changing emotions. Meanwhile, the nominees for the Carnegie children\'s writing prize include Philip Reeve for Railhead. Reeve is best known for his Mortal Engines quartet of books and has won many children\'s writing awards, including the Carnegie for Here Lies Arthur. Railhead is an intergalactic fantasy thriller about a petty thief in which hi-tech trains transport people between planets and galaxies. It\'s up against seven other books, which seem mainly to have stories based on the issues of identity, survival, love and friendship. Lauren Wolk\'s Wolf Hollow tells of a young girl trying to find her sense of identity while coping with bullying in a small US town in the 1940s. Mal Peet, meanwhile, is posthumously shortlisted for his last book Beck, a \"coming of age epic\" about a mixed-race boy in 1900s America. Peet died before finishing the story, so Meg Rosoff - who was brought on board as co-author from the start - is also nominated for completing it. Other names on the Kate Greenaway list include Jim Kay for his work on JK Rowling\'s illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone. The winners for both the Carnegie Medal and the Kate Greenaway Medal will be announced on 19 June. The winners will receiving a gold medal, £5, 000 and £500 of books to donate to their local library. The Carnegie Medal was established in 1936 in memory of the Scottish-born philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. The Kate Greenaway Medal, named after the popular 19th Century artist, followed 19 years later. ',entertainment
'Uber suspends self-driving cars after Arizona crash Uber has pulled its self-driving cars from the roads after an accident which left one of the vehicles on its side. Pictures posted online showed the car on its right side on an Arizona street, next to another badly damaged vehicle. The car - a Volvo SUV - was in self-driving mode at the time of the crash, on Friday, Uber said. No one was hurt. A spokeswoman for the police in Tempe, Arizona said the accident occurred when another vehicle \"failed to yield\" to the Uber car at a left turn.\"There was a person behind the wheel. It is uncertain at this time if they were controlling the vehicle at the time of the collision,\" spokeswoman Josie Montenegro said. Uber\'s self-driving cars always have a human in the driving seat who can take over the controls. The company pulled its self-driving vehicles off the road in Arizona at first, followed by test sites in Pennsylvania and California - all three states where it operated the vehicles. The incident follows a tumultuous few weeks for the car-hailing app service, after several negative stories about workplace practices and ethics. A number of executives have quit in recent weeks, including the president, Jeff Jones.',tech
'The multi-millionaire who is giving his business away Multi-millionaire businessman John Elliott leaves little doubt about his economic patriotism as his Jaguar car nears his factory in north-east England.\"Look at this area, it once produced the world\'s first locomotive steam engine, and now the Japanese, Hitachi, are producing our trains,\" he says dismissively as he drives. The straight-talking 73-year-old is the founder and boss of manufacturing business Ebac. Set up in 1972 to make dehumidifiers, in the past year it has also started producing the first British designed and built washing machine for 40 years. Ebac is based in the County Durham town of Newton Aycliffe, just a few miles from where Mr Elliott was born, and he has ensured that it will remain that way - in perpetuity. Instead of his two daughters inheriting the business and his £70m fortune when he dies, in 2012 he handed ownership of the company over to a trust, the Ebac Foundation.\"The trust means the company can never be sold,\" says Mr Elliott. \"I never felt it was mine to sell.\"Under the trust arrangement, Ebac must maintain all work in Newton Aycliffe, and any surplus profits are used to help community groups, such as the local football club. Mr Elliott, who still leads the company, and is one of the foundation\'s four current trustees, says that his children, who both work for the business, are happy with the arrangement. He adds that he was particularly determined to ensure that Ebac could never be moved abroad.\"We could make more money if we started to make our products in Poland,\" he says. \"But, personally, I would rather make a smaller profit and assist the UK economy than make a bigger profit and devalue the UK economy.\"\'Low skilled\' With more than 200 members of staff, Ebac is a sizable employer in an economically deprived area, but Mr Elliott\'s opinions about his workforce may raise some eyebrows.\"They are not very ambitious but they\'re not second-class citizens, and there are a lot of them in the UK,\" he says. \"They are reasonably well motivated, but they\'re at a low skill level.\"Mr Elliott, who was against the introduction of the minimum wage because he views it as a brake on productivity, says it is wrong for generations of UK politicians to think that everyone should do well in school and get lots of qualifications.\"The wrong idea was that we should make everyone in Britain very, very clever so we wouldn\'t need to do any hard work,\" he says.\"[Instead], half the people in the UK - or thereabouts - want to work in factories like this,\" he says. \"It\'s their choice, they\'re not here by force. If they would rather do an unskilled or semi-skilled job at a lower rate of pay then that\'s their preference.\"He adds that while the UK still has a manufacturing industry it can be proud of, he is disappointed that so much of it is now in foreign hands. Mr Elliott himself left school at 15 with no qualifications. Looking back on this, he says: \"My biggest regret? Two wasted years - I should have left at 13.\"\'No deal breaker\' Born and raised in a coal mining village near Bishop Auckland, County Durham, Mr Elliott and his two brothers were brought up by their mother and grandparents after his father died when he was six months old. After leaving school he became an electrical engineering apprentice, going on to work for a number of local companies. His big break came in 1972 when he was 29, a client asked him to design an industrial humidifier and he set up his own company to make it. And thus Ebac [then known as Elliott Brothers Air Control] was born. Ebac has grown over the years, and today also makes water coolers and air-conditioning systems. Its annual turnover is more than £15m, with profits exceeding £3m. A keen supporter of Brexit - the UK leaving the European Union - Mr Elliott says it is a massive opportunity for the country, which the UK should embrace.\"Currently we sell to France and we sell to the US,\" he says. \"The US has tariffs and that\'s an inconvenience, but it\'s not a deal breaker.\"The way you sell stuff is to come up with things people want to buy. \"People imagine the UK won\'t be able to sell anything anymore to Europe. No, no, no. The rest of the world trades with Europe, you just have to deal with tariffs.\"Emma Roberts, head of industrial strategy at the CBI business lobby group, says it is pleasing that Ebac is focusing on \"making a success of Brexit\". While Ebac\'s washing machines are currently only available at just 20 outlets in north-east England, Mr Elliott has plans to increase production. He says that its £10m washing machine assembly line could produce more than 250, 000 made in the UK washing machines per year.',business
'Lena Dunham hits back after weight criticism Lena Dunham has hit back after criticism about her recent weight loss. The star and creator of HBO\'s Girls has attracted headlines recently about her dramatic new look. But in a lengthy , she said her weight loss \"isn\'t some sign I\'ve finally given in to the voices of trolls\".\"Right now I\'m struggling to control my endometriosis through a healthy diet and exercise,\" she explained. \"So my weight loss isn\'t a triumph.\"The 30-year-old wrote: \"I feel I\'ve made it pretty clear over the years that I don\'t [care] what anyone else feels about my body.\" The actress is well-known for speaking out about her weight. She once criticised a magazine who she thought had altered her picture to make her look thinner (), and earlier this year she Glamour for not airbrushing her figure. Writing on Instagram on Friday, Dunham said: \"I\'ve gone on red carpets in couture as a size 14. I\'ve done sex scenes days after surgery, mottled with scars.\'Proud of what this body has seen and done\' \"I\'ve accepted that my body is an ever-changing organism, not a fixed entity - what goes up must come down and vice versa.\"I smile just as wide no matter my current size because I\'m proud of what this body has seen and done and represented.\"The actress also said she had a problem with media features featuring before and after pictures, adding: \"Don\'t we have infinitely more pressing news to attend to?\" Dunham is far from the first actress to have had her weight scrutinised in the media. In 2013, Jennifer Lawrence has said \"it should be illegal to call someone fat on TV\", after red carpet criticism of her own figure.\"Because why is humiliating people funny?\" . Keira Knightley from the Daily Mail in 2007, when the paper published an article about her weight. A photograph of Knightley, who was 22 at the time, was printed alongside an article about a girl who had died of anorexia. The actress\'s solicitor said \"deeply offensive\" suggestions could imply Knightley had an eating disorder and bore responsibility for the girl\'s death. Last week, Gabourey Sidibe revealed she had undergone a gastric band procedure to improve her health. In her new memoir, This is Just My Face, the Empire star writes: \"I did not get this surgery to be beautiful. I did it so I can walk around comfortably in heels.\"\"I want to do a cartwheel.

'Big data unites the study of stars with cancer research The study of the stars and the fight against cancer may seem to have little in common but the two have been brought together by the algorithms that read big data. Every day we create 2. 5 quintillion bytes of data - 90\% of the data in the world today has been created in the past two years alone. This amount of data has in turn driven a revolution in ever smarter computers that can make sense of all that information. Medicine is just one area benefiting from this closer relationship between information and machines. The collaboration between astronomers and oncologists began at a cross-disciplinary meeting in Cambridge to discuss data management. At the meeting, Dr Nicholas Walton, an astronomer, met James Brenton from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute. Prof Carlos Caldas, who also works at Cancer Research UK, explains what happened next.\"Astronomers are looking at pictures of the sky, but they can\'t sift through millions of pictures by hand, so they use imaging algorithms that can analyse and classify objects,\" he says. \"We obtain images from humans. Could we deploy the same algorithms to read that data?\" The answer was yes and the algorithm has been advancing the study of cancer ever since.\"Using the astronomy algorithm, we can automatically classify hundreds of thousands of cells, we can look at patterns, how cells are related to each other, we can precisely count them and find the average distance between cells,\" Prof Caldas says.\"It speeds up diagnosis and allows us to glean information that had previously been glossed over.\"It is completely transforming pathology into the digital realm. \"The sky is the limit.\"Scientists at Cancer Research UK have just announced a breakthrough in the way they \"read\" breast cancer cells. It means that they are now able to create a 3D map that links the shape of breast cancer cells to genes turning on and off, matching it to real disease outcomes. It is not just the diagnosis of disease that can be transformed by big-data insights.\"Data is exploding but so is the technology and that understand and exploit it,\" said Nick Millman, a managing director at consultancy firm Accenture.\"In health, the techniques that have previously been used in marketing analytics that have allowed brands to understand an individual\'s preferences can be applied to wellness - how to encourage someone to follow a healthier diet, for instance.\" Big data is the key theme of an exhibition currently running at London\'s Science Museum, which looks not just at how it is transforming industry but also how our own data footprints are affecting our privacy. Sheldon Paquin, the exhibition\'s curator, told the BBC: \"This silent revolution has completely changed everything about our lives, from how we look to the stars, to our trips to the doctor, to how we talk with one another. We imagine the modern world to be fast-paced, connected and interwoven with technology, all things that we owe inescapably to big data.\"We can now examine the evolution of language, search the genome for disease, navigate cities yet to be built and identify our common fears. Our increased connectivity is making us easier to read.\"The exhibition features a study done at Cambridge University, which illustrates how easy it is to read our personalities via Facebook likes. Volunteers were asked to complete a series of personality tests and that was compared with their Facebook data.\"We found we could predict personality as accurately as a spouse from the average person\'s Facebook likes,\" said David Stillwell.\"We could predict intelligence, personality traits, age, gender, religious views.\" Now the team has turned its attention to working out how much data we share with our increasingly smart cities - in a partnership with games publisher Ubisoft to promote its futuristic city game Watch Dogs 2. Just as Watch Dogs, which is based in a city run by an operating system that collects and analyses data on every citizen, assumes that privacy will be a distant concern in our future urban environment. The tool generates psychological predictions from users\' Facebook data as well as finding relationships between gender and salary, location and crime risks, personality and life expectancy. But can citizens turn their data footprints to their own advantage? CitizenMe is one of a growing number of firms that aims to offer people the chance to better understand the data that is collected on them as well as allowing them to sell it. It enables people to collect copies of their data from around the internet and put it into an app on their phone. \"These insights and data quickly become very valuable. If they wish to, citizens can choose to anonymously exchange some data for immediate cash reward,\" explained StJohn Deakins, the founder of the company. The app is currently being trialled with about 10, 000 people. How much data? 350, 000 tweets every minute 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute three million Facebook posts uploaded every minute four million Facebook \"likes\" every minute four million Google searches every minute 2. 5 quintillion bytes of data are now circulating around the world, 90\% of which has been created in the past two years a total of 44 zettabytes of data will be in circulation by 2020 ',tech
'Coronation Street praised for child grooming storyline Charities have praised ITV soap Coronation Street for its current storyline about child grooming. Wednesday night\'s episode saw Nathan Curtis imply he would soon be making his much younger girlfriend Bethany Platt available to his friends for sex. Ofcom confirmed it had received one complaint about the storyline. But children\'s charity Barnardo\'s praised the soap for \"shining a light on this serious but little discussed issue\". Viewers have been watching the relationship between 35-year-old Nathan and 17-year-old Bethany develop over recent weeks. Nathan has bought her alcohol and gifts including a mobile phone and Bethany has introduced him to her mother and partner, who were shocked to discover their age gap. On Wednesday, Nathan was seen taking Bethany to a party at his flat where he introduced her to his male friends. One of them said he would \"like to see a bit more\" of Bethany but Nathan replied: \"I told you mate, it\'s not the right time.\"Nathan tells his friend he would be \"the first to know\" when Bethany was \"ready\". A spokesman for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) told the BBC: \"Soaps play an important part in highlighting abuse and in giving victims the courage to speak out.\"We hope it will raise awareness of the signs of grooming and encourage more victims to come forward and seek help.\"The NSPCC has been working with Coronation Street producers on the storyline and had put the show\'s writers in touch with a survivor of child grooming.\"We are very grateful to the bravery of Lucie, a victim of child sexual exploitation, who shared her experiences with the writers and actors involved as part of their research for this sensitive storyline,\" the spokesman said. After Wednesday evening\'s episode aired, some viewers took to social media to express their discomfort about the scenes. Laura : \"That storyline with the blonde on Coronation Street is grim. No need for that before 8pm on a weekday.\"Beth the storyline \"literally makes me feel sick,\" while Lauren the scenes made her \"uncomfortable\". Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardo\'s, acknowledged some viewers would be uneasy but said it would raise awareness about the issue.\"This storyline makes for difficult watching but it\'s important as many people as possible are aware of the signs of grooming, so we can prevent this abuse happening,\" he said. \"Like Bethany\'s character, the young victims of this crime mistakenly think these child sex abusers care for them because they\'re often showered with presents and attention.\"Coronation Street producer Kate Oates told the BBC: \"Bethany\'s story has been crafted over many months, to create an awareness for viewers about the dangers of grooming. \"Bethany\'s story is a challenging watch, but we hope it will encourage open discussion amongst friends and families about self-esteem, confidence and most importantly, safety.\"Last month, Fallon told Lorraine Kelly the scenes had been \"uncomfortable\" to film. But, she added: \"It\'s so important for it to be on, especially at this time, because we\'re targeting young viewers watching before watershed - it\'s so important to target those people.\"',entertainment
'The Who\'s Pete Townshend writes new song for rock opera Tommy Move over, Pinball Wizard. The Who\'s rock opera Tommy is getting a new song. Guitarist Pete Townshend has written the \"torch song\" for a new touring production of his musical, which opens at the end of this month. The show, based on The Who\'s 1969 concept album, tells the story of a young boy who is so traumatised by his father\'s murder that he chooses to stop communicating with the outside world. This latest version, directed by Kerry Michael, features a reworked opening with Townsend\'s new song Acid Queen 2 in the second act. It will be performed by Peter Straker, who plays prostitute and drug dealer the Acid Queen. \"I\'m quite elated about,\" Straker told the BBC during a break in rehearsals. \"To have a new song in it is a great honour - I hope I can do it well.\" The actor and singer appeared in the original West End production of Tommy back in 1979, in the role of the narrator. \"The Acid Queen is a shaman-like character, a very powerful figure,\" Straker explained. \"But in Act Two she hasn\'t healed Tommy and the song deals with how you deal with fame when it\'s faded.\"In the 1975 film version of Tommy, the Acid Queen was played by Tina Turner, with Elton John as the Pinball Wizard and The Who\'s Roger Daltrey in the lead role.\'FEEL the music\' The Tommy tour features a cast of deaf, disabled and non-disabled actors from the Ramps on the Moon theatre project. Townshend said: \"When I heard that there was a new planned production of Tommy, I was pleased of course. \"But when I heard they planned to do a production featuring actors with disabilities of various kinds, that will actually throw new light on the original story, I became very excited. \"This is a totally new adventure, and really does refer back to my original story in which a young man, disabled by extreme trauma, finds his way to some kind of spiritual place because he can FEEL music. I can\'t wait to see it.\" Straker said he\'d been keen to revisit Tommy almost 40 years after its London premiere. \"I remember people at the Queen\'s Theatre complaining that it was too loud.
